(Wei Yun, Chu Yu)

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.120
What did you wish for?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.520
I can't tell you.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.160
Or it won't come true.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.870
Don't worry.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.310
If it doesn't come true,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.030
I will make it come true.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.840
When I am around,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.520
you can do whatever you want

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.800
and always be safe.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.980
If you say so...

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.120
I hereby appoint you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.310
as my personal bodyguard.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.470
What do you say?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.310
Do you accept?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.190
It would be my honor.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.420
(Wei Yun, Chu Yu)

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.150
Let's go.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.300
(Wei Yun, Chu Yu)

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.360
Excuse me. Make way, please.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.200
Thank you.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.080
My Lady,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.840
it's too crowded.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.030
Shall we come another day?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.710
No. We've come this far.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.960
I won't give up halfway.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.710
I have to be the first

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.550
to put up my plaque.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.590
Excuse me.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.710
Thank you.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.840
Excuse me. Make way.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.150
Let me through.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.240
Yeah, why is she pushing in?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.520
What's her problem?

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.150
- Get in line.
- Excuse me.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.990
Sorry.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.400
- Make way.
- Get in line.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.240
I'm sorry.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.200
I'll take you there.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.960
Come on.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.470
My Lady,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.520
wait for me.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.360
What's his problem?

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.950
Hey, you. Why are you cutting in line?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120
How could they push in?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.960
Yeah.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.840
You...

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.910
Be quiet.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.030
Don't talk.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.840
Why are you here?

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.360
I knew you would come

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.580
to hang the first plaque.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.950
So, early this morning,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.190
I declined Yun's mission

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.320
and waited for you.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.510
I'm going to help you

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.630
hang the first plaque.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.680
That's my business.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.000
No need for you to bother.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.120
But I insist on helping you.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.270
Look.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.320
I got you this.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.340
(Chu Jin)

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.240
A golden plaque made for you.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.680
Take it.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.560
I can't take it.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.830
Don't say that.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.080
Just take it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.040
- It's open.
- Come on.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.070
Come on, Jin. Hurry.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.470
Let's hurry up.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.170
Stop crowding.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.920
What are you doing?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.430
How could you do this?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.360
Shame on you.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.750
Jin, you go up there.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.590
I'll hold them back.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.240
I tried really hard.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.360
Why are we still late?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.680
Someone hung the first plaque

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.680
by cheating.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.800
Since luck wasn't on my side,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.510
I won't insist.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.070
Jin, don't lose heart.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.750
Luck didn't favor you,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.880
but I would.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.510
Hang this golden plaque.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.840
It's not the first,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.040
but the most valuable

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.880
and eye-catching.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.490
Let's hurry up.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.540
Hey, gentleman.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.430
Don't get in the way.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.950
We need to hang our plaques.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.040
Let's not push.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.200
Someone hung it.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.300
Now, let's try

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.230
to be the second.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.710
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.270
Let's hurry up.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.320
Mr. Song,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.120
before, I didn't know

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120
what I truly wanted.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.510
So, I wanted everything.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.600
But now, I've figured it out.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680
I have simple wishes.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.920
This valuable plaque isn't necessary.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.510
You have grand wishes.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.600
So, you should keep it for yourself.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.200
Let me through.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.880
Let me through.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.780
(Chu Jin)

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.860
(Chu Jin)

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
I will find a way

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.830
to make both our wishes come true.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.740
(Chu Jin)

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.380
(Wei Yun, Chu Yu)

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.150
Patterned umbrellas.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.480
Pretty umbrellas.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.360
Come take a look.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.630
We have wind-bells and pinwheels.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.240
Pendants and sachets to sell.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.320
- Wei Yun.
- Chu Yu.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.390
- You first.
- You first.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.870
Just now,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.030
what were you going to tell me

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.040
in Tugu Temple?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.350
Chu Yu.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.270
- I...
- Sugar figures.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.600
Sugar figures to sell.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.480
Twelve animal signs.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.720
All kinds of figures.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.870
Sugar figures to sell.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.240
Sugar figures.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.440
Sugar figures to sell.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.760
Get in and hide.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.780
It rained suddenly.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.110
I remember

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.750
on Spring Breeze House,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.750
you danced beautifully in red.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.750
My brother asked me

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.120
if I thought you were gorgeous.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.150
I didn't reply.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.440
But I indeed admitted it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.840
Chu Yu,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.960
I'm not sure whether

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.000
I loved you at first sight

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.150
or my love grew over time.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.390
I haven't figured it out yet.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.200
But I think

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.390
it may be both.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.630
That day, up there,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.550
I saw you return in triumph.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.360
You rode among your brothers,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.480
surrounded by the crowd.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.360
At that time, I was thinking,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.790
"He's just a spoiled young man."

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.470
But I was wrong.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.240
Your family suddenly failed.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.870
Instead of falling,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.200
you supported your family alone.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.360
You're a young general.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.600
You're far and away

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.480
the Young Marquis.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.670
You helped me.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.150
You helped me, too.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200
Since I was little,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.600
I've always been eccentric.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.080
I also became infamous

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.240
in countless cases.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.040
However,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.840
no matter how improperly

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.720
I behaved,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.390
you never blamed me.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.000
You even

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.000
risked your life for me.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.080
Thank you.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.720
You make me trust people again.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.790
I lost my father

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600
and was betrayed.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.270
Maybe even heaven

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.360
took pity on me.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.270
So, I met you.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.550
This is also my luck.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.200
Chu Yu.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.000
Will you be with me?

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.060
(Divorce Paper)
If you do,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.030
take the paper.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.560
From now on,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.600
you are simply Chu Yu

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.440
and I am Wei Yun.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.060
(Divorce Paper)

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.000
It's supposed to be mine.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.510
Why have you kept it?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.600
So, are you saying...?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.120
I accept you.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.960
You know me, respect me,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.270
and love me.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.840
There's no reason

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.390
that I don't like you.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.510
After we catch Yao Yong's mastermind

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.120
and settle everything,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.000
I will tell people

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.000
about our relationship.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.440
We hung our plaques.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.480
My wish came true.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960
It's time for business.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.000
Did you find Shen You?

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.080
Yes.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.360
He's hiding in an inn

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.510
beside Spring Breeze House.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.790
Wei Qiu is spying on him.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.000
Since he dared to flee back here,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.720
it means the man he works for

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.560
must be in this city.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.720
All we need to do is wait.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.470
That's right.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.270
He can't hide

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.270
in the inn forever.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.200
He will meet that man.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.080
Then, let's see

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.480
who will outlast the other.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.510
We've already kissed.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.910
Don't be too shy

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.120
to hold hands.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.120
That's different.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.960
Your hand is sweating.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.840
I won't let go, anyway.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.270
With the divorce paper,

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.910
you're free now.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.510
You don't need to rush

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.360
back home, do you?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.080
Stay for more days.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.110
When my sisters-in-law know

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:10.030
you're leaving,

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.400
they'll have a lot to say.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.000
You can just say, "I can't bear to leave you."

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:20.960
You aren't as straightforward

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.800
as you used to be.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.670
You're right.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.590
I can't bear to leave you.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.830
Then...

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.200
I can go home

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.720
in a few more days.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.110
Chun.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.080
Chun.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.480
Am I seeing it wrong?

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.000
Maybe when I'm out here,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.310
I've lost my mind.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.350
That's right.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.590
Yu is from a military family.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.720
She isn't punctilious.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.070
It's normal

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.240
- that they're close.
- Yeah.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.240
Lan, don't worry.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.000
Look, it's cold at night.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.200
And you're pregnant.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.240
Don't get a cold.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.790
Let's go back home.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.720
Alright.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.560
- Let's go.
- Yes.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.280
Be careful.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.380
How could you be so bold?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.830
You sneaked into my room

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.160
in the middle of the night.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.440
You accepted me.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.350
Yu,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.680
now I want

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.070
to be with you every moment

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.080
and never leave you.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.670
Alright.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.400
It's too late. You go back.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.680
Don't get caught.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.910
Fine.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.030
But soon, we will be

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.200
a proper couple.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.840
Yu,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.720
I expect the day

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.960
we become husband and wife.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.630
Cloth to sell.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.860
(Free Medical Service)

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.510
Song Wenchang,

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.750
if your idea doesn't work,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.030
I'll complain to Father.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.400
See how he'll punish you.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.440
Four examinations.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.830
Free medical service.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.310
Medical service.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.630
Miss,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.240
is it really free?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.760
Yes.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.920
Then...

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.960
In that case,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.180
it must be a scam.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.400
A young lady like you doesn't

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.750
look like a physician.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.240
I don't believe it.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.560
But...

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.960
Sir,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.590
your philtrum is flat.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.880
The whites of your eyes are yellow.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.140
Signs of liver damage
from overindulgence

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.440
and kidney deficiency.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.510
You either have alcohol addiction,

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.670
or...

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.480
Or you often go to the brothels.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.630
Nonsense.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.510
Oh, I see.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.350
I totally see.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.440
Go home with me now.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.200
Sweetheart, don't trust her.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480
You're so gorgeous.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.450
How would I

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.790
go to the brothels?

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.790
Stop making a fool of yourself here.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.240
Hey, sweetheart. Be gentle.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.310
I'll fix you.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.960
What a bad friend.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.110
Ridiculous.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.150
Oh...

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.480
So,

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.350
does anyone need this?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.920
Pretty lady, you're so kind.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.910
Check on me first.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.680
- I was here first.
- I was.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.520
- It's me.
- What?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.480
Take it easy.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.870
One at a time.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.840
One by one.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.070
This is a free service.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.510
But after it's done,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.310
I need you

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.920
to do a small thing for me.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.560
A small thing?

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.040
But...

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.800
General,

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.400
a lot of people suddenly came,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.750
saying they had letters for you.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.110
Before I accepted the letters,
they wouldn't leave.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.680
So, I brought the letters in.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.790
"Uphill grow trees,
on the trees boughs grow.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.790
My heart goes to you..."

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.240
Why is it unfinished?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.960
"I have feelings for you, but you..."

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.350
Why is it unfinished too?

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.910
These are letters

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.680
from Miss Song.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.110
So, she's asking

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.440
how you feel about her.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.000
Qingping has feelings for me.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.480
How could I not know?

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.680
But the thing

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.880
between us

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.680
can't just be clarified

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.200
by these simple poems.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.640
General,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.480
where are you going?

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.280
It's time

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.310
I made everything clear to her.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.080
Chu Shan,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.430
don't follow me.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.670
Alright.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.140
(She throws...)

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.200
(Free Medical Service)

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.030
"She throws a peach to me,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.400
I give her a white jade.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.110
Now in turn, you see,

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.750
but to show friendship made."

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.550
But where can I find a peach?

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.240
After Linyang receives the letters,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.790
he will come to me.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.960
Linyang.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.440
Miss Song, can I deliver

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.750
the last letter for you?

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.160
Of course.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.510
Miss Song,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.310
why are you doing this here?

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.550
Because I'm sick.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.800
I need medicine.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.000
So, I'm here.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.000
But you don't look like

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.030
you are sick.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.950
I...

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.590
I'm lovesick.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.240
Linyang,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.400
you're my cure.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.550
Your brother Wenchang

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.110
taught you to do this

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.830
and say that,

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.670
right?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.590
So, the cure

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.030
he prescribed for you

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.880
didn't seem to work.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.400
It worked.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.750
You came, after all.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.790
Miss Song,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.270
since the day we met,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.440
I've only ever taken you as a sister.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.200
I have

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.440
no other feelings for you.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.440
So...

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.920
Did you also become my tester

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.510
just because you wanted

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.510
to make a sister happy?

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.040
At that banquet,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.680
you saved my sister.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.320
It is only natural

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.920
that I repay the favor.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.480
I know

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.510
you have feelings for me.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.440
But today,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.270
I must tell you the truth.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.200
If I hold you up in your marriage thing,

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.000
I will feel sorry

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.160
for your father.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.110
I...

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.280
I don't believe that.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.790
Linyang,

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.030
you like me.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.160
This isn't the real reason.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.830
I'm sorry

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.590
I disappoint you.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.430
In the future,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.550
hope you'll take care of yourself

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.160
and get a good husband.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.270
Linyang.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.000
Linyang!

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:34.830
Linyang.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.350
Alright. Leave me.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.080
Yun.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.240
This is the blueprint
of the improved crossbow.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.640
I know you're worried.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.000
I brought it to you.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.500
(Improvement of Octagonal Crossbow)

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.080
So, is this...?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.840
It suits you well.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.680
Did you just...?

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:53.870
Just now,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.310
a little bug

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.400
flew into my eye.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.960
It flew away.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.950
Your Lordship.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.840
My Lady.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.270
Ms. Jiang asked me to tell you.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.000
"The meal is ready."

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:54.670
Look at this.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.830
- Try it.
- Very fresh.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.960
Flowers. Flowers to sell.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.170
If you don't believe me, try.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.520
How is everything?

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.640
Nothing special.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.760
We're watching him.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.440
You asked for the jewelry box.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.510
I fetched it.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.030
Sit.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.760
You're not needed here.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.070
Leave us.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.840
Xiang used to take care of you,

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.680
Your Highness.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.280
Why isn't she here?

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.880
She went home, pleading illness.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.880
You've recovered for a long time.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.960
Tonight, I'll have a drink with you.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.200
Come on.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.670
This is a toast to you

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.400
for risking your life for me.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.710
Do you remember

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.510
why I gave you

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.590
this name?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.160
When we first met,

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.670
you thought I was like

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.000
a proud plum blossom in winter.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.320
Even if the wind was piercingly cold,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.760
I never yielded.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.510
So, you named me Hanmei.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.590
All these years,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.070
you never

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.190
disappointed me.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.880
Even when I totally collapsed

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.440
and everybody left me,

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.190
you still stood firmly

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.360
by my side.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.630
If I were in a dilemma again,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.960
would you make the same choice?

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.360
- Your Highness.
- You know.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.280
I hate to be deceived.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.030
If the same thing happened again,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.190
I would make the same choice.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.800
I wasn't saying the same thing.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.510
I mean now.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.880
The other day, Chu Yu visited me

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.110
and gave me another gift.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.190
Would you like to see it?

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.840
Mrs. Wei always pursues new things.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.840
It must be a gift

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.800
that pleases you.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.480
What do you think, Hanmei?

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.510
Can it please me?

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.000
Your Highness,

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.550
why do you suspect me

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.710
for a mere pattern?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.880
There are always excuses.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.670
I won't argue.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:50.950
What about this?

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.110
It was found in your herb garden.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.280
The pattern on this bottle

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.230
is exactly the same as the one

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.110
on North Qi's letter.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.590
You asked for the jewelry box.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.110
So, you sent me away

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.320
and had my yard searched, right?

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.440
After a long search,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.360
did you only get this?

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.600
I didn't expect this.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.840
I didn't want to dump

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.880
your medicine bottles,

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.510
so I buried them in my garden.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.280
Now, they're evidence against me.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.110
I hate it the most when I'm deceived.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.510
Hanmei.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.990
Oh, no.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.880
Zhao Yue.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.510
Do you not want to defend yourself

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.280
or do you have nothing to say?

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.950
Until today,

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.550
how I wished

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.440
Chu Yu had never come.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.600
And how I wished it weren't you.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.670
But now, you can't even say anything

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.550
to defend yourself.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.360
How can I believe you?

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.150
You know how much

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.920
this country means to me.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.800
But you used me

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.510
to have done so many harmful things.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.190
What do you take me for?

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.480
And what am I to you?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.550
You flirt with other followers,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.630
but keep the safest distance from me.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.840
I accompany you, regardless of my life.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.190
But you've never cared about me.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.160
It is true.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.440
I used you.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.910
Because I wanted more

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.880
than being a follower.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.710
And I didn't want to fight

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.670
for your little bit of favor.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.670
So, when I was assassinated,

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.190
your protection on me

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.960
was also part of your plan.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.110
Yes.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.280
You suspected me.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
If I hadn't been injured,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.400
how could I dispel

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.280
your doubts?

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.400
But how would I bear to kill you?

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.120
I only wanted to kill

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.480
those officials who were loyal,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.800
stubborn, and inflexible.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.190
Those who threatened me.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.990
Your Highness,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.960
I would rather die

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.920
than harm you.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.630
Killing those annoying people

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.960
is why I've been lying low

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.360
for so many years.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.280
However,

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.510
I have true feelings for you.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.200
Your Highness.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.440
You poisoned the wine.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.400
Now that you revealed your intentions,

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:39.920
I won't let you live.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.070
You even bewitched Xiang

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.590
who served me for years

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.320
and she betrayed me.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.510
In that case,

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.550
I will let you meet

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:57.190
in the underworld.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.630
- You...
- Why am I not dead?

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.840
You hated to kill you.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.960
So, you only drugged me.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.360
I gave you a chance earlier.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.030
But you missed your chance to kill me.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.280
Annexing Great Sui

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.440
is my lifelong ambition.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.000
No one will change that.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.470
Your Highness,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.920
don't look at me like that.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.800
You ended up like this

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.800
due to your momentary kindness.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.630
You used me to harm my own country.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.880
I won't let you live.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.110
Today, I will kill you!

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.280
Xue Hanmei,

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.550
just now,

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.670
I did relent for the sake

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.510
of our past.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.000
But now, I won't.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.600
As for you...

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.880
A traitor deserves death.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.630
Take them away!

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:46.470
Yes.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.200
Move.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.240
Move.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.360
(Now that the truth came out,)

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.630
(I should answer for my brother.)
