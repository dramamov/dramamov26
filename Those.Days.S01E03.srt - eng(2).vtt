=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.900
=Episode 3=

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.479
This is Nanzhou Police Department,

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.520
Nanhu Precinct.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.800
Are you Yu Jingxiang's daughter?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.240
Yes, that's me.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.720
I told you.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.679
I told you she was.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.600
I'm an officer of Nanhu Precinct.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.279
Yu Jingxiang is in our station now.

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:37.160
Let me ask you again,

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:39.119
are you Yu Jingxiang's daughter?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.479
Yes, I am.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.000
See?

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.000
Honey,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.039
didn't I transfer you the money?

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.119
I want to see you.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:47.839
Mom...

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:49.919
I'm warning you,

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:51.240
the station is currently

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.360
verifying all your
identification records.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.440
If we find out you've
used a false identity

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.560
or impersonated someone else,

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:59.319
you'll be charged with fraud.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.000
We'll open a formal investigation
according to the law.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.240
Do you understand?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.039
I'll ask you one last time,

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.440
are you Yu Jingxiang's daughter?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.839
Honey,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.679
say something!

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.679
Say something!

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.599
You scammed Yu Jingxiang
out of 3,000 yuan.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.410
You're going to
pay it back right now.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.080
You're my daughter! I know it!

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.119
Mom, this is their stuff!

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.920
This is their stuff!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.879
It's their phone!

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.760
I'm sorry!

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.999
Let's go to the supermarket, Mom!

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.250
There's a discount for the eggs.

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:36.320
Let's go buy some eggs.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.920
Come on.

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.119
Easy there.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.960
Hi, Mr. Feng.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.320
Hi, Mingzhu.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.279
Have a seat.

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:53.839
Okay.

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.119
Come, sit.

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:57.719
Have some tea.

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:59.520
It's fine, sir.

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.320
I heard from Director Zhao

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.520
that you've moved all
your reception business

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.360
to our Nanxi Hotel.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.760
I really appreciate that.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.879
I wasn't sure what to bring,

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.080
so I got you some tea.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.520
Jianqi said you're a tea lover.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.420
Come on, we're family.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.279
You shouldn't have.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.760
Don't do this again next time.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.200
I'm sorry for the other day.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.320
My brother was a little harsh.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.320
He made things awkward
for you and Mrs. Feng.

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.520
We should've been more
considerate that day.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.420
A happy occasion got derailed
by heated words.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.480
Please talk to your parents

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:34.480
and calm them down.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.360
I'll speak with Jianqi's mom too.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.679
Her temper isn't great.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.910
I hope for your understanding.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.640
Anyway, this wedding

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.200
has to be both respectable and grand.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.760
Honestly, I don't mind what
kind of wedding we have.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.480
As my mom always says,
"A moment of glory

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.370
isn't as important as
a lifetime of stability."

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:54.960
Your mom is right.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.360
But then again,

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.399
Mingzhu,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.080
I've been in business

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.240
for years.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.200
I have friends,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.480
leaders,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.520
contacts from all walks
of life to consider.

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.260
We have to put on a event
that reflects well on us.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.439
Don't worry, leave everything to me.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.480
Lijun Hotel is massive.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.879
It can host over a hundred tables.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.240
You must invite
all your relatives and friends.

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:20.640
That puts me at ease.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.640
I'll let Jianqi know right away.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.650
Here, have some water.

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:25.240
Here.

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.399
How is Jianqi?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.640
He's doing great.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.320
He's even gained weight.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200
Focus on your work.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.000
Well, someone's feeling
generous after that feast.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.530
Now you're out here
doing good deeds.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.479
Oh, hardly.

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.520
That whole bottle of water is his.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.440
Drink more then.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960
Drink more.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.799
That meal was just too rich.

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.039
Hello.

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:07.479
Honey,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.159
want to go swimming tonight?

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.399
What's with the sudden urge to swim?

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:17.479
I feel like I'm soaking
in brine right now.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.719
I need a dip to dilute it a bit.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.120
Still salty?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.039
Not at all. It's sweet now.

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:36.599
Want a taste?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.399
Tell you what, let's have a race.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.450
I'll give you a three-length head start.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.880
You think you can outswim me?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.560
Let's try it.

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:53.399
I'll start then.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.000
That's two body lengths.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.399
That's three!

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:00.880
I'm coming!

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.359
What's the point of all this?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.599
This is the price for
abandoning a child

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:26.239
Dad.

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.279
Mom is already heartbroken.

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.239
That's enough.

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:44.560
Try not to take it so hard.

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.960
My little sister was given
away almost 30 years ago.

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.520
She can't be found so quickly.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.520
It's just going to

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.039
take some time. Isn't it?

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.200
I lie awake night after night.

00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:01.039
The moment I close my eyes,

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.640
I can hear the baby

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.680
crying and crying.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.719
Your dad is right.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.560
This is my punishment.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.599
My karma.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.200
Mom.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.039
But you weren't the one
who gave her away.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.359
- It was Grandma.
- No, it wasn't her fault.

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:28.440
It wasn't your grandmother's fault.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:32.120
When I was pregnant with your sister,

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:37.039
my work unit was going through layoffs.

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:40.039
You know how I am.

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.479
I was so proud.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.760
I was terrified that having a child
would affect my work,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.599
that they would let me go.

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:51.799
Then...

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.000
When I found out

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:57.560
I was having twins,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.440
I thought,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.039
"It's impossible. How will we manage?"

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.159
I was so worried.

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.799
I told your grandmother,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.919
"We can't raise them both.

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:12.880
How could we possibly manage?

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.200
If a good family wanted a child,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.799
we could give one away."

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:21.919
I think your grandmother

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:25.799
took me seriously.

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:30.160
And back then, your dad...

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.520
Your dad was getting into trouble.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.560
He got into a fight,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.799
the police arrested him,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.440
and he was sent to prison for years.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.200
Mom...

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.919
Mom, please don't be like this.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.560
Don't overthink it.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.519
Now...

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.630
Right now, what matters most is

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.580
that we give it our all
to find my sister, okay?

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.719
Yes.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.560
Yes.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:52.599
We have to find your sister.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.239
We have to...

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.400
But even if we do,

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:02.200
then what?

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.160
What if she doesn't want to see me?

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.759
She probably hates me.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:10.359
I should die.

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:11.599
Oh, my gosh! Mom!

00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:12.440
Mom...

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.239
I should die.

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:14.639
You're scaring me, Mom!

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:15.719
I should die.

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:18.200
Mom, I'm still pregnant.

00:09:23.119 --> 00:09:23.999
Oh, yes.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.800
You're right.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.119
It's okay, honey.

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:28.440
I'm okay now.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.800
I'm okay.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.160
You should go home.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.320
Jiao...

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.359
Jiao is waiting for you to come home.

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.359
I'm okay now.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.080
I'm okay.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.440
Go home.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.759
I'm okay.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.759
Please enjoy your food.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.440
(Alipay payment received, 3,000 yuan.)

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.359
Got your salary?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.710
I transferred it to you immediately,
didn't even touch it.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:57.960
Is your 1,000 yuan monthly allowance

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.999
enough?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.719
Since you're being so good,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.960
I'll give you a raise.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.639
No need.

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:04.400
I just top up my phone,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.359
I don't use credit,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.460
I eat lunch in the cafeteria,
dinner with my parents.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:08.879
I can buy you a few milk teas,

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.359
get you flowers on holidays.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:12.999
Rhyming, huh?

00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:17.519
You're so annoying.

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:21.119
Hello.

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:22.639
Where are you, Xu Zhidong?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.599
Mom's been scammed.

00:10:23.599 --> 00:10:25.320
She's in really bad shape. Come home now.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.519
Okay, I got it.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.200
What's wrong?

00:10:34.999 --> 00:10:35.719
Nothing.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.639
My sister says Mom's
not doing well emotionally.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:38.879
Go home now.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.879
Don't worry about this,
I'll pack everything up.

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.440
Go!

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.160
Are you sure?

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.560
I bought the groupon coupon.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.759
I'll send it to you later.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.960
Zhidong.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.639
Yes?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.400
Don't ride too fast.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.040
Zhixia.

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:04.800
What took you so long?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.239
I was eating with Bichen.

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:07.080
I left as soon

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.960
as I got your call.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.879
I didn't wait.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.879
You could've just told me
on the phone.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.040
I wouldn't dare.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.320
If Bichen dumps me,
you have take responsibility.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.070
Right, I have to take responsibility
for everything.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.599
I'm your sister, not your mother.

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:19.040
You're just a mother to me.

00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:21.920
How's Mom doing?

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:23.239
Same as before.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.450
Sighing nonstop, looking
like she's lost the will to live.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.960
Listen,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.800
you'd better keep an eye on her.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.879
She gave you all her pension money.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.920
If she does something stupid,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.639
we'll both be motherless,

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:33.950
and you'll be broke on top of that.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.719
I've got to go. Jiao's waiting
for me to have dinner.

00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:36.759
Take care on your way back.

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:38.280
Keep an eye on her.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.040
You hear me?

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.639
Got it.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.160
Thanks.

00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:49.999
Sweetheart,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.920
I've never asked you this.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.359
Do you resent your birth parents?

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.479
No, I don't.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.999
If they hadn't given me away,

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.080
I wouldn't have
a wonderful mom like you.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.320
You should...

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.800
Leave this to me.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.239
Jianqi and Minghui are painting.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.479
Take the strawberries you
just washed over to them.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.960
Hey, Minghui,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800
did you add salt in my lunch?

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:38.599
Feng Jianqi,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.999
don't you dare make
baseless accusations.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.760
If you keep slandering me like this,
I'll sue you for defamation.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.920
Minghui.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:48.920
What?

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.200
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.040
Let me tell you, people your size

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.599
are easy to take down.

00:12:56.599 --> 00:12:57.440
Feng Jianqi,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.400
you're the one who's
been crashing at our place

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:01.879
and hogging my room.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.479
And you want to hit me?

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.759
Come on then.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.320
Hit me here. Come on.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.200
Hit me.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.280
Come on.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.320
You think I wouldn't?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.599
He wouldn't, but I would.

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:14.960
I know you would.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.040
Don't mind him. Here, have a strawberry.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.200
Sweet?

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.719
So sweet.

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:27.320
Right, too sweet.

00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:29.800
I want some too, Mingzhu.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.440
Go wash some from the fridge yourself.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.599
Shen Mingzhu!

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.040
You're ditching your
brother for your man already?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.320
Choosing a guy over family?

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:38.999
So what?

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.519
You're the worst!

00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:49.080
Notice anything different
about me today?

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.440
Did you get handsomer?

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.759
No, on me.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.560
Something on me. Look closer.

00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:01.680
You can search me.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.040
Hey, where are you touching?

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:05.999
In my pocket.

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:11.960
This is for me?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.040
I saw it while I was
out shopping today.

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:16.040
It's nothing expensive,

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:17.920
but it's meaningful.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.759
The ad said,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.920
"In sync with you every second."

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.280
I love you

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:24.920
every second.

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:26.479
I love you too.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
Put it on me.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.080
Okay.

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:32.400
Here.

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:37.160
Okay.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.960
Come on.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.479
Couple watches. Do you like it?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.759
Look at the second hand.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:45.599
They tick in perfect sync.

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:46.479
Exactly the same.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.320
That's why they call it
"in sync with you."

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.960
This is nice.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.719
Bao.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.320
What are you doing?

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.080
Are you abusing the animal?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.440
Get up. Have some strawberries.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.960
Want some?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:05.839
Here.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.200
Hold it.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.280
What's your name?

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.560
Should we call you Little Hui?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.519
You're mine now.

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.359
Where are you going?

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.960
What is this?

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.280
- What is this for?
- Don't move.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.359
Stay still.

00:16:06.239 --> 00:16:07.080
What is this for?

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.519
I was worried you'd do something stupid.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.639
You pulled it so hard.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.920
It's cutting off my circulation.
Don't whine.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.680
Are you worried about me?

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.800
Well, do you even need to ask?

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:24.680
You think I'm crazy?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.359
Xu Dacheng,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.639
can't you ever just talk nicely?

00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:42.119
Zhidong?

00:16:43.359 --> 00:16:44.080
Zhidong?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.440
What are you doing here?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.160
What are you doing?

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:48.800
Mom.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.560
What's wrong?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.200
Nothing.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.780
I was worried you'd do something stupid.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.080
Dad and I have to watch you together.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.800
Alright now.

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:04.920
Go back to your room.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.359
Sleep in your room.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.680
It's okay, I'm not tired.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.119
Just go to bed.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.200
I'm really not tired.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.960
Alright, honey.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.559
I'm okay now.

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:16.039
I've thought it through.

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:19.640
I have to live.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.680
I have to live well
and find your second sister.

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:24.600
Just for my second sister?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.319
And you guys too, of course.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.759
I have to stay alive and live well.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.559
If I died,

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.479
your dad would just find another wife.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.759
Men in their fifties and
sixties can still have kids.

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.759
And now the three-child
policy's open anyway.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:42.440
Why are you spouting nonsense
early in the morning?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.640
Tell me I'm wrong.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.840
Of course you're wrong.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.559
It's not just fifties or sixties,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.960
men can still have kids at eighty.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.200
Proud of it, huh?

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.799
Aren't you tired?

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.600
Alright, go to bed.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.640
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to make breakfast.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.960
Go back to bed.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.840
I'm coming with you.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.160
- Come on.
- Let's go together.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.680
Come on.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.740
(Nanzhou Elementary School)

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.360
Lu Bing,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.880
a little red flower for you.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:30.440
What are you up to this time?

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:31.680
And a tiny snake.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.960
Lu Bing, you're scaring it.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.120
It's scaring me!

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.960
Get it away from me!

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.600
Try to touch it.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.840
Shen Minghui, stay away from me!

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.450
It doesn't bite.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.440
I'm warning you, go away!

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.060
It's obedient.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.600
Are you okay?

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.319
Just you wait!

00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:47.920
She's mad.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.319
Shen Minghui!

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.559
Honey,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.960
you know what's special about chives?

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.079
What's so special about chives?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.519
Don't you get it?

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.039
With you, I'm stir-fried!

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.559
I saw it online.

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:40.640
What time is it now?

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.519
It's five twenty.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:45.760
You know what that means, right?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.519
From now on, I'm going to ask you

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:48.680
at this time every day.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.640
Feng Jianqi,

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:52.640
you're so gross.

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.479
"Five twenty," my foot.

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:57.120
You're a total idiot.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.920
Want me to give you another beating?

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.559
See? I didn't even do anything to him.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.559
Just bear with it.

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:02.479
Where's my soda?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.920
I gave it to Jianqi.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.559
Feng Jianqi!

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.540
Who said you could drink my Coke?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.880
What's the big deal? I bought it.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.279
Why shouldn't Jianqi have some?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.850
There's a whole case of it right there.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.079
That's not the same! Mine was chilled!

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.519
Mingzhu, why are you
always taking his side?

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:18.960
Go upstairs and do your homework.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:20.759
Leave me alone!

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.840
He's always looking for a fight with me.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.640
Just be the bigger person.

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:28.719
Honey,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.039
Do you know what chopsticks symbolize?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.759
Chopsticks have a meaning too?

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.510
What does one chopstick represent?

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:38.239
Being single?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.440
And two?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.960
No idea.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.719
A perfect pair, just like you and me.

00:20:44.719 --> 00:20:46.319
Shen Minghui! Shen Minghui, come out!

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.279
Where is he?

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.479
Who are you looking for?

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:51.479
What do you want?

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:54.079
What do you want?

00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:55.160
Who are you looking for?

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.600
Bully Lu Bing again, and I'll kill you!

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.799
Why did you hit him?

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.880
Are you okay, Jianqi?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.279
Jianqi?

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.559
I thought it was Shen Minghui?

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:05.279
Yes.

00:21:05.279 --> 00:21:05.759
Dude,

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:06.880
did you hit the wrong person?

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.120
Keep the bowls steady.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.120
Wipe that smirk off your face.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.880
Want me to punish you more?

00:21:21.479 --> 00:21:22.719
Why are you giving him water?

00:21:22.999 --> 00:21:24.239
He's thirsty!

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.920
What's the point of the punishment then?

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:29.039
But we can't let him get dehydrated!

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.759
Where are you going?

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.840
The Qiao family ordered
ten jin of pork chops.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.799
I'm delivering them.

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:34.479
You should stay.

00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:35.319
Don't you move.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:35.960
No, I mean,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.360
I'll go instead. They had a new baby.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.039
I haven't given them the red envelope.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.319
Mom, I'll go with you.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.759
Sure.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:43.880
I'll go with Mom.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.360
Okay.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.039
Jianqi, I'm going out with Mom.

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.200
I'll be back soon.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.600
Got it!

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.239
Hey,

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:50.160
tuck your legs in.

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:51.680
Closer.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.999
Hold it steady, steady now.

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:57.440
All you do

00:21:58.759 --> 00:21:59.880
is causing trouble.

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:01.799
Don't move.

00:22:02.999 --> 00:22:03.920
I'm watching you.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.039
Landlady,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.920
why is there no water?

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:48.759
Minghui?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.840
Minghui?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.279
Are you there?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.719
What is it, Jianqi?

00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:56.319
I'm out of hot water.

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:57.600
Can you take a look for me?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.759
Out of hot water?

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:00.600
Let me see.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.559
Jianqi,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.719
you took a beating for me today.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.999
That's real loyalty.

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:10.640
How about I give you a present?

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.239
I'm counting on you, Little Hui.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:18.600
Avenge me.

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:19.840
You got this.

00:23:20.279 --> 00:23:20.920
Go.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.920
Here's the hot water, Jianqi!

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.319
No! Go away!

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.400
There's a snake in here!

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.039
Minghui!

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:34.120
Minghui!

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:36.680
Minghui!

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.239
Open the door! I'm scared of snakes!

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:38.960
Minghui!

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.440
Open the door!

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.920
(A baby girl born on March 26)

00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:45.360
(was placed for adoption)

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.680
(due to special circumstances
at the Yujia Town Hospital.)

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.360
(A family search is now being
conducted through an online platform.)

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.200
The clues are too little.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.160
How can we possibly find her?

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:56.079
You don't know that. Publish it first.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.519
Go ahead.

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:00.960
You know, if my sister was adopted

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.200
by a wealthy family

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.360
and has a great life,

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.960
she might ignore our post
even if she sees it.

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:09.079
But if her life has been hard,

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:11.759
she'd definitely come

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.640
to confront my parents.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.200
She'd demand to know
why they gave her away.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.960
Should we still post it then?
I can delete it.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.840
No, don't delete it.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.360
I was just thinking out loud.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.920
Even if finding her
brings nothing but trouble,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.120
it's trouble our family deserves.

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:29.799
Let's sleep. We have
a lot to do tomorrow.

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:31.239
You're pregnant.

00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:33.039
You should really cut
back on your workload.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.600
Thank you for your concern, Hao.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.079
Now, be a dear and turn off the light.

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:45.479
Honey,

00:24:46.239 --> 00:24:48.759
do you want a boy or a girl?

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.440
I want a promotion and a raise.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.460
(Teacher's Office)

00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:57.440
This is Shen Minghui's
midterm exam paper.

00:24:57.719 --> 00:24:58.559
Take a look.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.200
His luck is just terrible.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.950
Even just picking C all the way
should have gotten him a few points.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.799
Tell me, was Shen Minghui adopted?

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:17.960
Your dad wouldn't come

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.960
to the school,

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960
and you, as his sister,

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.860
can still make jokes
after seeing his results.

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:23.479
If this is

00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:24.460
how your family

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.759
treat his education,
then we have nothing more to discuss.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.039
No, Mr. Sun, I didn't mean that.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.279
He's been in high school for five years.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.239
He's been a senior for nearly three.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.079
The curriculum is exactly the same,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.840
but his grades aren't getting better,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.999
they're getting worse.

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:39.759
Why?

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.880
He just hasn't been in the right
headspace for studying lately.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960
That's putting it mildly.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.960
He's not "out of the right headspace,"

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.079
he has no headspace for it at all.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.079
Of course,

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.680
he's very active in other areas.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.479
What other areas?

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.759
He brought a snake to school

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.400
and nearly scared Lu Bing to death.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.759
Do you know who Lu Bing is?

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:05.759
She's our top student

00:26:05.799 --> 00:26:07.960
She got into a top-tier
university last year

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.759
but didn't go.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.880
She's repeating her final year

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.050
specifically to aim for
Tsinghua or Peking University.

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.960
Wow, that's quite the gap between them.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.759
But don't worry, Mr. Sun,

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:19.960
the situation with Lu Bing
has been resolved.

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.600
Resolved? How?

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:24.279
Lu Bing's brother came
over with some guys

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.600
and beat up Minghui's brother-in-law.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.239
Even though they got the wrong guy,

00:26:28.239 --> 00:26:29.920
their family got it out of their system.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.560
Good that it's resolved.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.680
Anyway, here's the thing,

00:26:36.999 --> 00:26:39.360
we need to fix Minghui's

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:41.160
academic problem immediately.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:44.279
He's a bright kid.

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:45.239
Yes, he is.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.220
But he can't stay stuck
in his senior year forever.

00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:48.160
You're right.

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:49.360
Let's work together,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.719
the school and your family,

00:26:51.999 --> 00:26:53.840
to help him make some real progress.

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.160
Let's push hard this year

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.360
and get his grades up.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.440
Got it. We'll push him.

00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:08.200
Mom and Dad.

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:09.719
I'm home.

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:11.400
You're home.

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:13.319
How did it go?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.960
What did the school say?

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.200
Let me have some water first.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.880
Easy there.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.640
How did it go?

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:24.600
His teacher said a lot,

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:25.880
but to sum it up,

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.160
Nanzhou High School just wants to
get Minghui out as soon as possible.

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:30.759
Out? To where?

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:32.200
To college, of course.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.360
They've had enough of him.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.279
Oh, stop joking.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.120
College?

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.680
You think you can
just send him there?

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.120
Your family owns
the university now?

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.120
You have to pass the exams to get in!

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.920
You think I'm talking
about direct admission?

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.350
The teachers are desperate.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.279
They said as long as
Minghui's willing to study,

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:46.719
they'll even give him extra tutoring.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.479
No, no, we can't trouble
the teachers like that.

00:27:49.479 --> 00:27:51.079
They're busy
with all the graduating students.

00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:51.799
Yes.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:53.940
It's not right for them to
tutor our kid on top of that.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.880
We can't just dump
everything on the school.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.479
That's not right.

00:27:58.559 --> 00:27:59.999
Then who do we dump

00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:00.799
it on?

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:05.759
It's our family's issue.

00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:07.200
We should handle it ourselves,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.759
right?

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.559
What does that mean? Dump him on Jianqi?

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.279
Good idea.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.640
You want me to tutor Minghui?

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.920
His English is the worst.

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:21.400
Start with that.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.799
Honey,

00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:24.880
do you realize

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.799
your brother's been bullying me?

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.759
I know.

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:29.479
Just be the bigger person.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.799
My mom bullies my dad all the time too.

00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:33.360
That's different.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.120
Honey,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.880
does your mom put
salt in your dad's lunch?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.160
Does she turn off the hot water
while he's showering?

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.120
Does she turn off

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:41.759
the water

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:43.360
and throw a snake in there?

00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:45.160
A snake! A live snake!

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:46.920
Honey,

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.719
your English is so amazing!

00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:49.550
You just switch to it

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.430
like it's your native language
when it matters.

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:53.640
Please teach Minghui.

00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:54.680
Honey,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.279
hearing you praise me like that

00:28:57.279 --> 00:28:58.799
makes me feel blessed,

00:28:58.799 --> 00:28:59.999
but tutoring Minghui?

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.400
Sorry, that's a no.

00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:05.680
Look, just put up with my brother

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.559
for now.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.440
When your sister ever bullies me,

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.350
I'll put up with it too.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.160
Your sister's not exactly
easy to deal with either.

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:15.079
Okay?

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.400
Fine, fine.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.200
But at least make him
get rid of that snake first.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:27.319
Little Hui.

00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:29.120
Go on.

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:30.999
It's not that I don't want you,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.940
it's that Grandma and Grandpa
don't want you anymore.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.680
Go on, get out of here.

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.640
I let it go. Happy now?

00:29:44.719 --> 00:29:45.759
He looks reluctant.

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.120
He didn't want to let it go.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.239
Stay back, it might bite you.

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:51.400
It's not going to bite.

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:52.759
Snakes bite.

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:00.559
Come in.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.840
Alright, what are we studying?

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.950
Where's your English textbook?

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.239
English...

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:18.160
English book.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.440
Let's see what you've got.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.719
This book is falling apart.

00:30:29.719 --> 00:30:31.370
This is what "well-worn
from reading" looks like.

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:32.840
Didn't you know?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.750
Sure, let's wear this
one out a little more.

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.680
Sit up straight, feet down.

00:30:40.719 --> 00:30:41.799
Open to Unit One.

00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:43.719
Read it aloud, let me hear you.

00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:48.360
Open your mouth.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.160
"The Art History."

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.239
Minghui reads really well.

00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:57.400
His English sounds great.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.200
See, he does like to learn.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.079
He just never had the right teacher.

00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:03.920
"It's hard to give a..."

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.719
What's so funny?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.400
Nothing.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.920
"Precise definition."

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:12.719
Jianqi's English was
great back in college.

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:13.479
Mingzhu.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.479
I felt so relieved when I heard Jianqi

00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:18.880
was tutoring your brother.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.450
And the best part is, it's free.

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:22.799
Yes, makes the wallet feel even better.

00:31:24.719 --> 00:31:27.200
Is about a foot of space
enough for you two here?

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.039
Yes.

00:31:28.239 --> 00:31:29.120
I think it's enough.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120
It's enough.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.880
"Watching..."

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.239
Stop.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.239
Listen up.

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:38.360
When an infinitive is the subject,
the verb must be singular.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.319
For example,

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:41.319
"Watching TV is boring."

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:45.479
Jianqi,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.120
I didn't actually set
the little snake free.

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:52.960
I hid it.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.600
Where did you hide it?

00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:58.920
Where did I hide it?

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.039
I hid it...

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.600
I hid it...

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.079
Here!

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.360
Minghui!

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.279
No!

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.799
- Shen Minghui!
- Jianqi!

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:18.719
Jianqi!

00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:19.279
Minghui!

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:19.840
Jianqi!

00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:21.759
- You little brat!
- I got you!

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.279
You're asking for a spanking!

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:23.960
Pull me up!

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.239
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:26.759
You're stuck.

00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:27.400
Jianqi,

00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:28.690
I can't even save myself now.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.999
You're on your own, I can't help you!

00:32:29.999 --> 00:32:30.519
Minghui!

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:31.440
Minghui!

00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:32.559
Jianqi!

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:33.920
You're asking for it!

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:35.400
Stop right there!

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.960
Climb, Jianqi!

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:38.120
Mom!

00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:40.039
Stop right there, Shen Jianqi!

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:40.719
I'm sorry!

00:32:40.719 --> 00:32:41.120
Watch it!

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.120
Mom, stop chasing me!

00:32:43.479 --> 00:32:44.400
You little brat!

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.360
Mom!

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.079
Why did you have to be so mischievous?

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.840
My princess! I'm sorry! Please stop!

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.600
Princess, my foot!

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.319
Mom, don't come any closer!

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:53.999
Stop chasing me, Mom!

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:54.960
Mom!

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:56.079
Mom!

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.400
You're becoming like a three-year-old!

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.840
Come any closer, and I'll jump!

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.600
Go ahead! Jump!

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.950
It's not like you're fast
enough to catch me.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.840
I'm not fast enough?

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.799
I'm going to kill you!

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:04.600
I have to run!

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.270
Stop right there!

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:05.960
I have to go!

00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:07.039
Stop right there!

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:07.920
Run faster if you can!

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.999
You little rascal,

00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:11.799
are you trying to drive me mad?

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:16.360
Their family is probably
lively and happy right now.

00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:18.880
Meanwhile, our place is so
quiet that even the TV echoes.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.239
Maybe

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.920
we should pick a day

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.239
for both families to sit down
and talk again.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.120
No.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.039
There's nothing to talk about.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.279
It's a power game now.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120
If we back down,

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.319
they'll walk all over us.

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:42.039
But we're a family now.

00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:44.120
I just think

00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:47.360
we should try to handle things

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.559
with a little goodwill.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.440
What do you mean, "a family"?
Since when?

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.120
It's ridiculous.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.239
Our families aren't even well-matched.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.560
You think getting a marriage
certificate makes us family?

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.759
It's not that simple.

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:01.279
Why are you being so stubborn?

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:03.400
Stubborn? Who's being stubborn?

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.759
I'm being stubborn?

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.719
I'm just

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.759
setting the ground rules straight.

00:34:11.759 --> 00:34:14.559
They shouldn't think it's so easy
to marry into our family.

00:34:20.999 --> 00:34:21.800
Hello, Mr. Yu.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.840
Could you wait?

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.119
I'll coming right away.

00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:27.119
Who is it? You're going out?

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.760
Mr. Yu is looking for me.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.550
I'm meeting him at Lijun
to discuss business.

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:32.720
I might be late,

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.440
don't wait up.

00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:35.479
Go to bed first.

00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:47.960
Feng Jianqi,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.400
you're so timid.

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.240
You don't even fight back
when people hit you.

00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:54.599
What did my sister even see in you?

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.920
Are you even a man?

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:06.960
Shen Minghui,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.960
I've had enough of you.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.599
You got the guts

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:12.720
for a real man's duel?

00:35:14.519 --> 00:35:15.320
What are we doing?

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.440
You name it.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:20.880
Arm wrestling. You dare?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.559
Come on.

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:29.240
Show me

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.760
what man-strength you've got.

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:31.960
Don't go easy on me.

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:33.920
Come on.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.240
Did we start?

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.119
Put some muscle into it!

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:52.479
Use your strength!

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.960
See now?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.750
I've been going easy
on you this whole time.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.360
Huh, the floor's pretty sturdy now.

00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:28.840
Shen Minghui, what are you doing?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.479
Be careful! It was just fixed!

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.320
Mind your own business!

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.999
You looking for a beating?

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.280
Only tough when you're with her.

00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:41.119
You and I are mortal enemies now!

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.999
Honey, you were amazing.

00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:45.960
It's time to put him in his place.

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:48.119
Yes! That's the spirit.

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:48.999
Show him who's boss.

00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:15.119
Yes!

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.119
Hui,

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:21.800
this ride's super steady!

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.119
Of course it is.

00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:25.039
Is that why you're rocking it so hard?

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.880
How's my driving skills?

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:28.960
Pretty good!
I don't feel carsick at all.

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:29.720
Let's go!

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.100
Full speed ahead!

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:31.679
Full speed!

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.039
Evening, how many of you?

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:40.639
Three.

00:37:40.639 --> 00:37:41.880
Okay, this way, please.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.400
A music restaurant.

00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:45.760
This place looks expensive.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.119
Don't worry. It's on Hui.

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:52.320
What do you want?

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.119
What can I get you?

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.320
Beer.

00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:56.360
A half-case of beer,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.800
and one soda water. Thanks.

00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:15.119
Madam He?

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:16.760
May I help you?

00:38:17.519 --> 00:38:18.400
No, I'm good.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.360
Mr. Feng is at that table over there.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.240
Let me take you there.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.039
It's fine.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.119
He's got a guest.
I don't want to interrupt.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:24.880
Okay.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.599
I'll call you if I need anything.

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:27.039
Okay.

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:27.599
Bye bye.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.519
Bye bye.

Didn't you sing it last time?

00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:29.199

your car was taken

sometimes likes to play jokes on me.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.599
I'll go get the car right now.

Don't bother.

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:07.199
