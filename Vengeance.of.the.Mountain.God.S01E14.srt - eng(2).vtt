00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.680
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.600
You can mess around if you want,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.000
but don't drag the Yang family in.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.760
I know what I'm doing.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.440
Stay out of my business.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.000
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.880
What are you laughing at?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.480
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.080
Me.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.880
Why am I laughing?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.160
I'm laughing at you.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.720
You... you...

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.880
You... you...

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240
All of you,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.880
always reciting the Guild's rules,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.920
but in your hearts,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.920
you're all scheming.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.120
You honor the Mountain God out loud,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.600
but inside,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.920
you're thinking of crooked ways.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.280
Isn't that right?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.560
My father always told me,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.880
the heroes of the Ginseng Guild

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400
were all Mountain Ginseng Gatherers.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.600
They weren't well-educated,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.600
but their hearts were pure.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.920
But now,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.080
you've turned the Guild

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.840
into a band of thieves.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.960
Arrogant.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.760
Just speaking the truth.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.720
Such a defiant youngster—

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.200
how should he be punished?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.480
Cudgel Execution! Cudgel Execution!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.560
Haiyue.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.720
How is it?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.640
There's no other way out.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.920
We have to break him out.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.920
Let me confirm one last time.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.040
You grab that pile of hay,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.600
go to the back door and set the woodshed on fire.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.560
I'll go in while the smoke is thick,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.600
and rescue Brother Jin.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.720
Let's split up, then.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.480
Meet at Uncle Jin's grave before dark.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.600
Haiyue.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.600
If something goes wrong,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.480
and I get caught by those bastards,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.240
run away fast.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.920
Stay alive.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.760
Don't jinx it.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.560
Cui Haiyue.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.000
I lo... lo... love...

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.760
Love... I... I love... I love...

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480
Don't forget me.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.200
Protect me.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.200
Cudgel Execution! Kneel!

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.920
Cudgel Execution!

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.400
Kneel!

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.560
Cudgel Execution! Cudgel Execution!

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.280
Mountain Ginseng Gatherers kneel to the Mountain God,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.000
kneel to the ancestors and parents,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.920
but never kneel to scoundrels.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.400
I told you not to kneel!

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.640
I don't care if you stand or kneel.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.840
Hurry up and do it!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.040
I'll do it myself.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.000
Who?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.640
Who are you?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.200
Haitang.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.360
This is more exciting than your stage play.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.280
Isn't it?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.000
Thanks to Boss He for showing me the world.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.480
Boss Jin.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.640
What kind of show is this?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.760
Boss He, please don't laugh.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.920
It's just a little misunderstanding.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.200
That's good.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.120
Touching Boss Jin means touching Liuhe Tang.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.280
No one wants to tear off this mask.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.480
Boss He.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.760
You came without even giving notice.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.200
When did Jin Shisan call for Liuhe Tang?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.640
No idea.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.960
Please, take a seat.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.360
Boss Jin.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.240
Boss Jin.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.680
Why is no one saving you a seat?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.280
He's saved!

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.360
He's saved!

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.240
Brother Jin is saved!

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.080
Jiu Ye.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.520
Harmony brings wealth.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.640
If our Boss Jin did anything wrong,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.520
and offended your Guild brothers,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.240
I, on behalf of Liuhe Tang, apologize to the Guild.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.240
Boss He, that's too much.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.200
You're shortening my life with this.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960
Brother Shisan.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.960
Your uncle is getting old.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.680
Sometimes he sticks to old ways.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.480
His mind isn't as sharp.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.960
How could I have a misunderstanding with Liuhe Tang?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.360
Help me explain.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.120
Jiu Ye.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.960
About Boss Lin—

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.480
I really can't find any evidence.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.360
Maybe you should just keep punishing me.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.520
No, no, no.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.360
Wait.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.360
The Boss Lin you're talking about—

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.240
is it Boss Lin from Songling Town's Lin Ginseng Shop?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.760
Alright.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.400
Jiu Ye.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.480
Let me air my grievances, too.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.760
Please judge for me.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.040
Not long ago,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.760
the Master asked specifically for the Seven Fairies.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.760
He sent me to buy them.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.360
Boss Lin said he had them,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.800
and sold them to me at a high price.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.480
I was careless,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.240
and didn't see it was fake ginseng.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.120
The Master has such sharp eyes,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.760
he spotted the fake instantly.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.800
He was truly furious.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.240
I nearly lost my head,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.400
and your whole Songling Town almost vanished.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.240
Luckily, Boss Jin saved everyone.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.800
He offered his family's Seven Fairies.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.120
Only then did the Master calm down.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.520
That freed me up,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.360
so Boss Lin's whole family learned

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.960
there's no medicine for regret in this world.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.800
What... what's going on?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.800
It's about time.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.640
Listen up, all of you!

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.960
Whoever gets the Nine Immortals' Compass first—

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.080
Jiu Ye will guarantee him a lifetime of riches.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.680
Yes!

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.200
Go!

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.280
Wait!

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.080
Manager Cui.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.400
Jiu Ye has new orders.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.240
Speak.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.520
Jiu Ye says to withdraw.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.080
Withdraw!

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.680
Has Boss Jin's misunderstanding with everyone
been resolved?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.960
There was never any misunderstanding.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.040
Brother Shisan,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.080
all of us in the Ginseng Guild

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.760
pay our respects to Boss Jin.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.760
Jiu Ye,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.680
everyone,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080
please rise, please rise, please rise.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.200
Let this matter be put to rest.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.360
Boss Jin is generous and magnanimous.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.680
Yes, yes.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.960
Thank you, Boss Jin. Thank you, Boss Jin.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.800
Alright.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.360
The misunderstanding is cleared up.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.080
Now, let me get to business.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.800
Our Liuhe Tang will open ten ginseng shops
in Fengtian.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.520
Ten shops, ten in total.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.920
These ten ginseng shops

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.080
will all be managed by Boss Jin.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.760
He'll handle all ten shops.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.960
Can he manage them all?

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.040
That's none of your concern.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.920
Boss He, rest assured.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.640
Fengtian is a place full of all sorts.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.800
Good ginseng is priceless and rare.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.800
But our Songling Town ginseng

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.360
is abundant and of high quality.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.160
And our Mountain Ginseng Gatherer skills

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.120
are passed down from our ancestors.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.360
They're renowned throughout the Northeast.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:48.920
Isn't that right?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.880
Yes, that's right, yes.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.320
Good.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.240
Yes, that's true.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.920
Let's do business together.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.880
Let's prosper together.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.040
As for how you work with the other
Ginseng Guild bosses,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.040
how you cooperate,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120
I won't interfere.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.240
It's all up to you.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.720
Jiu Ye,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.160
the one lying on the ground

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.320
has the deepest misunderstanding
with Liuhe Tang.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.120
I'd like to invite him to the capital
for a drink.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.600
To clear up the misunderstanding.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.720
Is that alright?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.680
Boss He has spoken.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.680
Do as you please.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.480
Then I'll take him with me.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.800
Jiu Ye,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.480
Save me, Jiu Ye!

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.040
I'm your favorite, you know!

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.120
Jiu Ye, save me!

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.720
Everyone,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.480
let's thank Boss Jin.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.560
Thank you, Boss Jin. Much appreciated.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.120
You're all too kind.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.240
Thank you, Boss Jin. Much appreciated.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240
Thank you, Boss Jin.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.120
You're all too polite, too polite.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.680
Thank you so much. We'll rely on Boss Jin.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.240
Thank you, thank you.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.880
Boss Jin, thanks. We'll count on you
from now on.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.360
We'll rely on Boss Jin. Thank you.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.560
Boss He,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.720
Boss He,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.920
Are you satisfied?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.680
Phoenix's Single Tear.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600
That's a fine name.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.480
The Elder Master of the Hall

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.480
is like a phoenix descending from the heavens.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.320
When the elder heard this name,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.920
she believed it was a heavenly blessing.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.320
She sent me here in a hurry.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.040
Boss Jin loves to keep people guessing.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.160
He only said it was an important guest.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.440
When I met Boss He,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.040
I realized it was Liuhe Tang's business.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.480
Here.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.440
You're giving too much.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.120
If the Elder Master is happy,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.480
we errand runners get some luck too.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.600
Boss Jin,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.360
I've left another batch at your place.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.240
Remember to check the goods.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.320
Alright.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Boss He, take care.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.720
Jin Shisan,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.600
you've worried me to death these days.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.240
Do you know that?

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.680
You say nothing at all.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120
You just watch us all get anxious.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.720
Does that make you happy?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.320
No.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.360
I had already arranged with Boss He

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.440
to buy your ginseng.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.480
And to do you a favor.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320
But I didn't expect

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.880
you'd act against me so quickly.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.560
And ran right into Liuhe Tang's jaws.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.920
You helped me sell the ginseng
at a sky-high price.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.120
At least let me treat you to a meal.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.000
Another day.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.480
Boss He left some goods.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.480
I need to go check them.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.320
I'll head out first.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.880
Boss He,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.800
Boss He, please wait.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.720
May I have a word with you?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.040
Boss He,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.240
There's a rumor in the Ginseng Guild

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.000
that Liuhe Tang and the foreigners
plan to open a factory in Fengtian.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.360
It's true.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.360
But the foreigners' terms

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.600
didn't satisfy the Elder Master.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.000
It's already fallen through.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.120
Boss He,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.480
I have a request.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.720
Could you hold off on releasing
this news

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.680
until three days from now?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.800
I just need three days.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.600
Once it's done,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.040
I'll give you all of Duan Jiu's assets.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.320
All will be yours, Boss He.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.920
Looks like Boss Jin is confident.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:25.800
Alright.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.600
I'll play along with you.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.360
Thank you, Boss He.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:50.800
Baobao,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.240
go keep watch outside.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.360
Don't worry, brother.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:10.920
Spare me, Master!

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.680
Spare me, Master!

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.120
It's all that old Duan's fault.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.240
He made me do it.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.600
Tell me something I don't know.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.360
Maybe I'll let you live.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.440
Duan wants to take from you

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.000
the Dragon's Twin Incense and
the Nine Immortals' Compass.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.360
That's right.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.920
When Duan was drunk once,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.800
he let slip

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.680
that the Jin family's massacre
at the Mountain God Temple

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.920
was all Duan's scheme.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.320
Dad

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.680
You're in such good spirits today.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.680
Ruyi,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.680
This is the banknote from selling
Phoenix's Single Tear.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.560
Please take a look.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.360
From now on,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.920
any business transactions on the books

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.800
handled by you don't need to be reported to me.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.240
Just hand them straight to the accountant.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.160
I understand.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.720
It's just that this deal is so big,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.360
I felt I should at least let you know.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.560
To me, this deal

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.560
isn't about the money.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.120
It's Jin Shisan himself

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.920
who's truly valuable.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.480
Ruyi,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.880
you're the one who really gained from this deal.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.800
Dad, I...

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.360
I've been through all this before.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.600
You think I don't know what's on your mind?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.040
Ruyi,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.320
invite Jin Shisan over to our home.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.680
I'll help you check him out.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.680
Okay.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:47.480
Alright, alright, alright.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.040
Thank you, thank you. Congratulations!

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.720
Please come in, come inside.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.360
Congratulations, thank you.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.120
Come in, come in. Congratulations, thank you.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.440
Congratulations, congratulations! Please come in.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.680
Come in, come in, come in. Thank you.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.560
Congratulations, Boss Jin. Best wishes.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.360
Thank you. Congratulations! Please come in.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.240
Come in. Congratulations.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.160
Jiu Ye, please calm down.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.040
Take a look.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.480
What do you think of this one?

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.160
Come here, miss.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.720
Take a look.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.160
Looks nice.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.800
Buy it.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.440
Let's go with this one.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.920
It's like the popular style in the capital.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.920
Looks good.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.560
Buy it.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.680
You're thinking about Jin Shisan, aren't you?

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.880
It's pretty.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.440
Buy it.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.040
You're definitely distracted.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.240
Come on, tell me.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.320
I'll help you figure it out.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.680
My dad wants to meet him.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.800
Meeting the parents?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.040
That's moving fast.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.560
Keep your voice down.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.800
How far have you two gotten?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.680
Holding hands.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.040
Kissing.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.120
Or have you gone all the way?

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.120
Miss,

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120
I don't care about my reputation.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.120
Sorry, sorry.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.800
Let's get back to business.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.920
Go ahead.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.240
Jin Shisan is so closed-off.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.000
He never says flattering things.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.240
What if he upsets my dad?

00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.880
If he doesn't approve,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.320
then just elope.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.000
Don't worry.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.000
I'll cover for you two when you run away.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
I'll handle everything.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.360
I knew I couldn't count on you.
