00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
Congratulations, congratulations!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.680
Boss Wang, Boss Wang.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.760
Long time no see.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.480
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.120
Please, have a seat inside.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.520
Alright, alright.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.240
Please, come inside.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.520
Okay, alright.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.320
Congratulations, Boss Liu!

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.960
Please take a seat in the
private room upstairs.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.320
Let's go, upstairs.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.760
Okay.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.080
Congratulations to you, Qi Ye.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.920
So impressive, isn't it?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.080
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.080
Just being here is enough.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.440
Your daughter is beautiful too.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.080
Good, good.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.080
Boss He.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.280
Boss Lin, Boss Lin.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.000
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.240
Take it easy.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.720
Qi Ye.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.160
Congratulations!

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160
Thank you, same to you!

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.000
Boss Lin.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.040
Congratulations to you.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.760
Boss Lin.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.520
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.440
Please, have a seat.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.600
Boss He.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.400
Boss He.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.440
Qi Ye, long time no see.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.400
Congratulations to you.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.560
May your fortune be as vast
as the Eastern Sea.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.880
Thank you, Boss He,
for honoring us today.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760
And this is...

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.000
This is Haitang.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.840
The famous one in Beijing,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.760
the Peking Opera star
everyone wants to see.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.200
Boss Haitang.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.760
Haitang.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920
Go greet Qi Ye now.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.960
Haitang greets Qi Ye.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.320
Wishing Qi Ye a long life
like the Southern Mountain.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.960
Not at all.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.600
Qi Ye.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.320
Has Duan Jiu Ye arrived?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.520
Not yet.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080
Are you looking for him?

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.360
Today is Qi Ye's big day.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.920
We're all here to honor him.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440
Not at all, you flatter me.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.640
Please, Boss He and Boss Haitang,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.400
this way to the private room.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.000
He—Boss He, Boss He.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Private room, this way.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.640
Qi Ye.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.400
Congratulations to you.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.320
Wishing you fortune
as vast as the Eastern Sea.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.600
And you are...?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.920
Look over here.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.760
Fortune as the Eastern Sea,
life as the Southern Mountain.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.160
Old Jiu.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.200
Weren't you in Beiping?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.240
Depends on whose birthday it is.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.960
Where do I sit?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.880
Upstairs, private room.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.520
Please, Jiu'er, let's go.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.880
Come on, come on.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.240
Eunhee.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.880
Look at this pillar.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.240
It's made of golden sandalwood.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.040
Look.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.160
Haiyue.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.040
Look.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.680
That man over there—

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.880
That's Boss Fu from
the biggest firm, Pinghetang.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
I've asked around.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.040
He just bought a batch
of top-quality big ginseng.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.400
Follow me in a bit.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680
Let's get them together.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.400
This flowerpot—

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680
It's clearly an antique.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.040
No.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.040
Sis.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.600
Sis.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.600
Can you be a little more ambitious?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.400
I don't know why Dad let you

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.320
become the leader.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.160
The young lady has arrived!

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.040
Everyone, make way!

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
Hurry up, Ruyi!

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.160
We've been waiting for you.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.880
Is it starting soon?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.960
Why are you dressed like that?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.240
Quick, get her changed.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.880
As long as we're not late,
it's fine.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.880
Hurry, let's go.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.320
Let's go.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.600
Ruyi, why are you so late?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.240
Yang Tingxuan.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.880
Let me tell you—

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.320
Tingxuan smells like alcohol.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.040
What's up with your brother?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.800
Sorry.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.960
Brother Tingxuan, long time no see.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.600
Come, Ruyi.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800
Young Master Lin, sorry.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.520
We’re late.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.760
No need to say that, Miss Yang.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.960
You’re an honored guest.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.680
Guests of honor always arrive last.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.040
My father is unwell today.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.760
So he couldn’t come to celebrate Uncle Lin’s birthday.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.240
Sorry.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.800
I’m here today to wish Uncle Lin a happy birthday.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200
I brought a six-leaf ginseng I dug up myself.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.920
Wishing Uncle Lin a long, healthy life.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.480
Ruyi.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.360
You’re amazing.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.640
This is too valuable.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.640
Let me thank Qi Ye on my father’s behalf.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.200
And also Brother Tingxuan.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.160
Of course.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.640
But most of all,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.600
I must thank my sister Ruyi.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.200
Please, upstairs.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.200
Let’s go.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.800
Let’s go.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.360
Please.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.200
Please.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.200
Brother Tingxuan.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.080
After you, Mr. Wang.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.400
This Lin guy is really rich.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.200
He booked this huge restaurant just like that.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.080
That’s nothing.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.520
The whole Changbai Restaurant belongs to the Lin family.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.960
Three years ago, he used the Divine Compass taken from the Jin family

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.760
to control everyone with power.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.920
He started the Ginseng Market.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.920
Officially, it’s run by all ginseng traders in Guandong.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.960
But for three years, Qi Ye has been in charge.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.400
What’s the Ginseng Market?

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.240
The Ginseng Market

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.520
is where merchants from everywhere

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.920
gather to trade ginseng.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.400
It’s held every March.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.960
This year, it coincides with the Grand Mountain Assembly.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.520
So it’s even livelier.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.400
Ginseng traders from all over the country gather here.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.640
Qi Ye is the host.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.040
Just from the trade commissions,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.680
he makes a fortune.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.160
All at the cost of the Jin family back then.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.040
Young Master Yang.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.320
Please take a look.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.760
Please name your price.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.040
Both ginsengs, one price.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.960
Eight thousand silver dollars.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.920
All for eight thousand.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.800
But that’s seven roots!

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.240
Alright.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.920
Deal.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.800
Take them.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.920
Let’s go.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.080
Thanks to everyone’s luck today,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.200
I got two fine ginsengs.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.360
Look here.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.920
This one

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.760
is a four-leaf club.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.200
A regular four-leaf now

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.480
is worth twelve hundred silver dollars.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.800
And this one

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.360
is a Four Palms General.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.080
The best among four-leaf ginsengs.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.760
Over thirty years old.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.320
Worth three thousand.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.920
Three thousand, three thousand.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.600
The key is

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.480
there’s more.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.760
This June Frost.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.920
The best among six-leaf ginsengs.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.360
Look at the stem.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.600
At least forty years old.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.800
See these diamond-shaped deep grooves.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.600
And the rootlets are covered in pearl dots.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.480
This one’s worth at least seven or eight thousand.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.800
Maybe even ten thousand.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.200
Seven, eight thousand, even ten thousand?

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.960
That valuable?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.920
Young Master Tingxuan may have lost out this time.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.480
He got tricked.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.800
Hey, you inside.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.360
You didn’t even check the goods.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.040
I advise you not to talk nonsense.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920
Those five roots

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.400
are below four-leaf grade,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.200
but they’re top quality among their kind.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.480
Altogether, they’re worth a thousand or more.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.360
Maybe the low price blinded you.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.920
You got distracted by the bargain.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.920
And forgot the Four Palms General

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240
and June Frost are the real prize.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.680
Who’d forget?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.960
I was after those two treasures from the start.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.920
The other five were just a bonus.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.080
Why not take a good deal?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.800
Alright.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.600
Let’s talk about your two ginsengs.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.480
This Four Palms General before you—

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.160
its skin color is fake.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.800
Try rubbing it with your hand, Young Master Tingxuan.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.680
I’m sure you see it now.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.680
Now, about your June Frost.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.680
Its shape is fine,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.040
and the rootlets are full of pearl dots.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.440
But be careful,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.800
the rootlets break easily.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.920
If they break,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.160
you’ll see the break point.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.360
It should be tender and white.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.800
That means it’s not wild old ginseng.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.160
Fake! Fake! Not wild ginseng!

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.480
It’s a scam!

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.480
Trying to fool the Yang family?

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:30.680
Guards!

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.160
Go after those two!

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.920
Brother.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.800
Enough, don’t embarrass us here.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.040
It’s just a few thousand silver dollars.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.680
Boss He.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.720
I’ll get straight to the point.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.800
Boss He,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.800
what business do you want with Qi Ye?

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.800
Our master asked our manager

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.360
to find a special ginseng for medicine.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.040
It must be top grade.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.160
Ordinary four- or five-leaf ginseng

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.480
won’t do at all.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.800
It has to be the Seven Fairies Jin Buhuan found.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.480
The Grand Mountain Assembly is about to start.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.800
We came to ask Qi Ye

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.480
to help us during the assembly

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.480
and dig up the Seven Fairies.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.800
Boss He,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.160
may wealth flow to you.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.280
Back then, Jin used the Nine Immortals Divine Compass

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.040
to find the Seven Fairies.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.160
But Jin later angered the Mountain God

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.040
and was punished.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.600
So—

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.680
Take a look at this.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.160
The Nine Immortals Divine Compass is now with my Lin family.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.000
If you want to find the Seven Fairies—

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.000
This is the deposit.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.600
If Qi Ye can dig up the Seven Fairies
this time,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.600
we'll pay another ten thousand dollars.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.160
Let's see who gets the best
ginseng root today.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.120
That Qi Ye...

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.720
He had the advantage back then.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.560
He relied on having the compass.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.920
Now he's reaching into my territory.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.000
If you show no mercy,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.720
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.840
Just as we spoke, Qi Ye came downstairs.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.680
Everyone,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.280
please take your seats.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040
Congratulations, Qi Ye.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.840
Congratulations to you as well.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.000
Please, have a seat.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.800
Hello, Qi Ye.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.680
Everyone,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.680
quiet down, please.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.920
Today,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.120
first, we celebrate my birthday.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.440
Second,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.560
I've prepared this opportunity for you all

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.360
to exchange what you have and need,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.120
and help each other.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.160
For three days from now,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.800
the Grand Mountain Assembly held
every three years.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.920
So everyone can gain something.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.040
Alright.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.800
There's an old saying in our trade,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.440
"When the compass appears,
the ginseng king is found."

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.680
Today, I, Lin, will present

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.120
a treasured item from my family.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.440
To liven up the gathering.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.160
Please, take a look.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.240
This is the legendary

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.040
Nine Immortals Divine Compass
that finds the ginseng king.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.680
It's said Jin Buhuan used it back then

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.360
to discover that

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.800
priceless Seven Fairies.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.680
Really?

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.040
Your family's treasure?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.440
Qi Ye Lin,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.840
are you getting senile?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.800
You're speaking without thinking.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.440
Jin Shisan!

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.360
What are you—

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.120
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.160
Why are you all just standing there?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.160
Hurry and throw him out!

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.480
Back then, my father and all
the Jin family

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.120
were buried beneath the mountain temple.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.280
And your Lin family

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.680
took the chance to kidnap me
and my sister,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.440
and stole the Nine Immortals Compass.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.600
You even tried to violate my sister,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.240
forcing her to take her own life.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.560
For these three years,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.240
your Lin family kept sending assassins

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.560
to take my life.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.440
Now you talk of virtue and morality here,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.000
throwing a grand banquet.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.680
My friend, you must be mistaken.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.600
The Lin family has always been upright.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.680
We were sworn brothers with Jin Batou.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.440
How could we do such disgraceful things?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.680
Three years ago, Jin Batou grew greedy.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
He was punished by the mountain god.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.240
That's why his whole clan was cursed.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.920
What does that have to do with us?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.680
Cursed?

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.800
Old Lin,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.240
why don't you check above your head

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.680
to see if a curse has fallen on you?

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.680
It was Lin Wancheng.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.600
He raided the Jin family,

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.360
stole the compass,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.040
and killed Jin family descendants.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.040
Lin Wancheng made me do it all.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.920
Spare me, please!

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.240
I'm telling the truth.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.240
You promised to spare my life.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.680
Nine Immortals Compass—

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.600
the ginseng king comes with it.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.040
The Nine Immortals Compass
belongs to my Jin family.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.360
It bears the Jin name.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.920
It will always bear the Jin name.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.920
Three days from now is my father's memorial.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.480
I came here today

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.840
to reclaim what belongs to the Jin family.
