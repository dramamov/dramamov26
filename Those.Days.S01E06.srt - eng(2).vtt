=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.780
=Episode 6=

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:32.440
Mrs. Feng.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.080
Mingzhu.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.720
Mr. Feng.

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:34.839
Mingzhu's up.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:37.399
I only meant to take a nap,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
but I slept all the way till now.

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:41.919
It's already dark out.

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:43.000
That's alright.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.919
You really should get some proper rest.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.960
Come, sit down.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.919
For now,

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.240
you don't need to rush back to work.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.119
Your father already spoke
with your boss.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:55.720
That's right.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.240
I ordered you a maternity meal plan.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.800
Their ingredients

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.720
are all organic.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.950
You can eat with peace of mind.

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.399
And there's premium bird's nest too.

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:08.839
It's expensive,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.240
but worth every penny.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.839
I don't need anything that fancy.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.160
Some prenatal vitamins are enough.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.919
No way.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.319
You need to eat well and stay healthy.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.800
You're carrying
the Feng family's grandchild.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080
Whether the baby is healthy or not,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.920
I'll need to do another check-up.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.960
Besides,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.240
I still haven't decided
whether to keep it.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.439
I'm sorry.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.200
Mingzhu,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.320
what's wrong with you, child?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.399
Didn't we already talk about this?

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:41.839
Everything was settled, wasn't it?

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.320
What are you still worried about?

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.119
You...

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.800
You and Jianqi loved each other so much.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.760
Don't you want to keep something of his?

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.439
It's decided then.

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:56.920
I've already ordered

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200
the maternity meals until your due date.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.839
After that, it'll switch
to postpartum meals.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.040
This is my decision to make.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.920
This child isn't just Jianqi's.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.960
It's mine too.

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.119
You girl, how could you...

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.399
- I...
- Alright, enough.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.119
We've said enough.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.399
Let Mingzhu decide for herself.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.599
Fine.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.960
Mrs. Feng.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.559
Can I have my phone back?

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:33.999
I turned it off already.

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:34.999
It was too noisy.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.119
Now eat, alright?

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.800
Hello, Doctor.

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.760
Hello.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.599
Aren't you the doctor who stood up

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.640
for the hero's wife?

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.279
Not just a good doctor,

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.360
but a brave man too.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.879
I just saw your video.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.159
What seems to be the problem?

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:21.279
This is my second pregnancy,
eight weeks in.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.360
With my first child,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.920
I didn't have any morning sickness.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.440
But this time I've been vomiting a lot,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.159
and quite badly.

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.599
It comes without warning.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.080
Could it be because of my age?

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.239
What do you think?

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:38.839
Maybe that's part of it.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.880
Stay positive and eat well.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.839
You'll be fine.

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:45.839
That makes me feel much better.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.640
Her name is Shen Mingzhu, right?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.719
Did she register here?

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.520
Why are you asking?

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:56.960
Just curious.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.520
Middle-aged women love to pry

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.880
and gossip.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.279
Less gossip is better
for both body and mind.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.950
Come, let's do another ultrasound.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.260
Pay at the counter to the right.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.159
Thank you.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.320
Sing one.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.520
Alright.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.560
I'll sing one I actually know.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.359
Make it a cheerful one.

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:29.960
Okay.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.200
♪Even if fate tosses and turns♪

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.719
♪Even if fate twists in strange ways♪

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.479
♪Even if fate tries to scare you♪

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.799
♪Life may lose its fun♪

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:39.599
♪Don't cry or be bitter♪

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.880
♪And never give up♪

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.440
♪I wish to stay by your side for life♪

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.320
Darling.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.760
You're going to be a dad soon.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.799
How do you feel?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.200
How do I feel?

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:01.640
I think I can express it through a song.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.479
Then sing it.

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:03.320
I will.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.640
What were the lyrics again?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.320
What's wrong?

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:11.359
Take this to your sister.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.440
- Okay.
- Fish soup.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.159
Your dad's been
simmering it all morning.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.880
Alright.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.359
Where are the car keys?

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:18.719
Right here.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.790
I'm heading out, Mom.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Hold it steady.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.359
- I will.
- Don't spill it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.719
Dad.

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:27.350
When you get there,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.960
take your sister out for a walk.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:32.359
She shouldn't stay home all day.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.239
Her mind is still on Feng Jianqi.

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:35.359
Got it.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.919
I'm going.

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:38.960
Go slow.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.520
Okay.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.359
Why are you painting again?

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:45.200
Didn't Jianqi already paint this?

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.680
Look at what he did.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.200
He barely put in any effort.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.239
That boy was never meant for hard work.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.200
You know,

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:02.599
if we hadn't

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.560
let him stay in our home back then,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
maybe none of this would have happened.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.680
Why think about it now?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.560
It's all over.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.359
Thinking won't change anything.

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.279
Come on, forget it.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.120
Let's go.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.159
Hurry up. Look at you.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.760
(Xin City Grand Court)

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.359
Hello.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.200
Hey, open the gate, buddy.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.399
Hello.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.399
Who are you here to see?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.239
Building Six, Unit 8002.

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:43.150
I'm visiting my sister.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.039
Please hold on.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.599
Hello, homeowner.

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:50.279
There's a...

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.159
Sir, your name please?

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.080
Shen.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.080
A Mr. Shen is here to see you.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.399
Alright.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.440
Sir.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.930
Please park your bike at the entrance.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.550
The resident will come down to meet you.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:15.799
Meiqi.

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:17.000
Hi.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.599
So polite.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.000
You even came down yourself to get me.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.950
The main gate
and the elevator need a key card.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.399
Without me, you couldn't get in.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.719
High-end communities
really are different.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.719
That's why they're safe.

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:39.479
No outsiders can get in.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.719
Meiqi.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.800
Let's have dinner together tonight.

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:44.839
I'm busy.

00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:51.780
I wasn't talking to you.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:54.320
I'm busy tonight.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.960
I'm having dinner at home.

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:00.719
When we get married,

00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:02.410
we can hang
our wedding photo on this wall.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.200
Don't people
usually hang it above the bed?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
Why here?

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.239
This way when I lie down,

00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:08.599
I can see it right away.

00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:10.160
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.960
You really have a high happiness index.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.839
Is my sister asleep?

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:33.440
No.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.560
Wear slippers.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.800
It's more comfortable barefoot.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.879
Mingzhu, I brought you some fish soup.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.400
I'll be right out.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.710
You don't need to bring soup anymore.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.440
Mom ordered nutritional soup for her.

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:18.639
A five-star chef makes it.
It's really expensive.

00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:21.040
But can it
ever taste like Mom's cooking?

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.440
Minghui.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.040
Mingzhu.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.639
Here, have some soup.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.560
It's still hot.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.200
Didn't you have tutoring today?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.999
It's pointless anyway.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.160
Why waste the money?

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.759
Come on, try it.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.200
Does it taste good?

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:52.150
This tastes just like Mom's cooking.

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.359
This afternoon Mom

00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:55.510
even asked Dad to catch
an old hen in the countryside.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.320
You'll have chicken soup tomorrow.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.080
Tell Mom not to work so hard.

00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:01.080
I can't eat that much anyway.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.599
That won't do, Mingzhu.

00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:05.639
It's better for Mom to stay busy.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.680
Otherwise she'll just keep nagging.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680
It drives everyone crazy.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.440
I really can't drink anymore.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.479
Help me finish it.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.920
You've only had a little.

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:17.920
No.

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:20.080
Mom said you have to drink more.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.780
Even if you're full, you still have to.

00:11:22.359 --> 00:11:23.479
Just think of it as medicine.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.080
That's such an old-fashioned idea.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.599
Mingzhu, drink if you want.

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:28.599
If you don't, then don't.

00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:29.920
Do whatever feels comfortable.

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:31.599
I know.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.200
By the way, Meiqi.

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:35.680
Could you please

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.200
help Minghui get an elevator card?

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.960
It'll be easier for him to visit.

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.999
You won't have to go down each time.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.759
Thank you, Meiqi.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.160
No way.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.800
Why should Shen Minghui
have an elevator card?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.119
Soon all his relatives

00:11:55.119 --> 00:11:56.639
will be coming over.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.320
What then?

00:11:57.719 --> 00:11:59.239
It'll be chaos. Absolutely not.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.759
You think I want to give him one?

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:03.280
Just looking at him annoys me.

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.759
He clearly has no manners.

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.999
Mingzhu, don't bother.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.759
Mom said you just need
to eat well and rest well.

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:10.910
Don't worry about anything else.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.359
She's already working hard enough.

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:13.599
I'll wash these dishes for you.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.599
Alright then.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.160
Are you keeping up with your studies?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.450
We've reviewed everything several times.

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:22.479
I'm fine.

00:12:22.479 --> 00:12:23.519
Work harder.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.599
Jianqi spent a lot of time tutoring you.

00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:27.519
I know.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.440
I'll study hard.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.719
So Jianqi can rest
in peace with a smile.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.200
Mingzhu.

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:38.680
Are you getting used to living here?

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.440
It's fine.

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:44.440
Why don't you come home with me?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.359
It's better for everyone if I stay here.

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.080
You look so tired.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.839
You shouldn't
keep pushing yourself like this.

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:51.479
It's alright.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.400
I'll adjust.

00:12:55.239 --> 00:12:56.440
Take good care of yourself.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.599
No matter what, I'll support you.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.680
If you really want to support me,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.200
then focus on your studies.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.680
Mingzhu.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.320
My Mom asked me to bring you some nuts.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.560
Thanks.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.719
Meiqi.

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:11.960
Did you get the elevator card made?

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:14.759
Not yet.

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:19.239
Mom wants to know
what Minghui wants for dinner.

00:13:19.239 --> 00:13:20.440
She'll have housekeeper cook.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.200
No need.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.960
Minghui's leaving soon.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.320
Don't go yet. You rarely come by.

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:27.400
It's not rare.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.130
I'll be back tomorrow
with chicken soup for my sister.

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:32.040
This is my sister's home.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.080
I can come whenever I want.

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:36.239
And leave whenever I want.

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:38.599
Fine, see yourself out.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.750
You don't need a card to go down.
Just press "1."

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:43.320
I'm leaving, Mingzhu.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.080
Take care of yourself.

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:46.239
Go slow.

00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:47.879
Bye.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.639
Bye.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.680
Copying others and losing your own way.
Faking it to join the crowd.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.560
Covering your ears
while stealing a bell.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.280
Zhixia...

00:13:59.239 --> 00:13:59.839
Look.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.239
I found Shen Mingzhu's
piano lesson account.

00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:04.879
She teaches kids piano online.

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:05.950
Two hundred yuan per lesson.

00:14:07.719 --> 00:14:08.359
Then do this.

00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:09.560
Contact her right away.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.680
Tell her our kid
wants to take piano lessons from her.

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:21.920
Hello.

00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:23.359
Hello, Ms. Shen.

00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:25.920
Ms. Shen, here's the situation.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.160
Our child

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:28.960
has a piano competition tomorrow.

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:33.479
We were hoping
you could give her a short lesson.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.260
I'm not available these days.

00:14:35.719 --> 00:14:37.519
You might want to find another teacher.

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:39.839
It could just be an online session.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.599
Ms. Shen, it's really urgent.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.200
It'll only take a few minutes, alright?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.879
Add me on WeChat.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:47.639
We can talk there.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.759
Okay, give me a second.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.560
What's your ID?

00:14:58.719 --> 00:15:00.680
I've added you,
please accept the request.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.639
Alright.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:03.879
Thank you.

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:12.040
Got it, she accepted.

00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:16.280
But I'm not in a competition tomorrow.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:23.519
Jiao.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.999
Don't you have a concert
at the end of the year?

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:28.040
Your teacher tomorrow

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:29.800
will be watching quietly.

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:32.359
They'll pick one student
for the featured performance.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.800
That's basically a competition,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.440
isn't it?

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.960
Then I want some spicy sticks.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.400
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.479
You can, but you have to listen to me.

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:50.519
Hello.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:58.519
Hello.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.040
Yes, the signal is good.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.800
I...

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:05.359
This is my daughter, Jiao.

00:16:05.359 --> 00:16:06.160
Say hello to Ms. Shen.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.200
Hello, Ms. Shen.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.080
Hello, Jiao.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.999
Ms. Shen...

00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:13.400
I'll let Jiao
play a short piece for you.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.960
You can listen and see what you think.

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:16.160
Sure.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.359
My homework isn't done yet.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.599
Spicy sticks.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.080
Wait a moment.

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.119
Look, doesn't she look like her?

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.160
That one, look at her.

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:31.040
She looks a bit like you.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.239
That's not me.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.839
Doesn't she look like Zhidong?

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:38.080
The nose and eyes.

00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:39.239
A little like Zhidong.

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:40.879
Yeah, I think so too.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.280
Jiao.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.719
Come here, Jiao.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.960
Jiao.

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:14.039
This piece has many high double notes.

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.160
So you need to play them lightly.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680
Sometimes playing lightly

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.200
is even harder than playing loud.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.600
Try to imagine your fingers

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.079
touching the ripples on a calm lake.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.279
Yes, that's it.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.960
You understand right after I say it.

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.680
You have real talent for music.

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:40.239
Ms. Shen, I really like you.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.999
Can you be my teacher from now on?

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.999
Jiao.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.440
Ms. Shen is very busy.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.799
You can practice on your own.

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:49.279
Ms. Shen.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.880
Ms. Shen.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.279
Thank you.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680
How much is the fee?

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:57.680
Is there a discount?

00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:58.799
No need.

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:01.880
If the child's feet can reach,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.039
she can use the pedal.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.039
Feel how the sound lingers.

00:18:05.239 --> 00:18:06.239
It's very beautiful.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.680
If anything comes up later,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.559
you can contact me.

00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:12.370
Let's leave it here for now.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.400
Okay.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:14.960
Goodbye.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.640
Goodbye.

00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:23.640
It must be fate.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.279
She teaches piano.

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:29.559
And Jiao happens to learn piano.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.880
Her smile feels so warm.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.719
There's something so familiar about her.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.440
Do you think

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.239
she could actually be my real sister?

00:18:59.279 --> 00:18:59.880
Hello.

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.559
I saw that.

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:12.799
You didn't even ring our doorbell.

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.079
You just let him in.

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:20.999
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.279
How did you get an elevator card?

00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:27.719
Feng Meiqi gave it to me.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.400
Feng Meiqi.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.200
Did you give Shen Minghui
that elevator card?

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920
Elevator card?

00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:45.519
Yes.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.040
I didn't give him any elevator card.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.920
How's that possible?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.079
He said it was from you.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.519
I was wondering where mine went.

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:56.759
That kid's just making things up again.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.680
Where are you going?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.060
None of your business.

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:12.039
No one's been
bothering you lately, right?

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:12.719
Don't worry.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.120
I'm here. No one would dare.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.840
Don't get me into trouble.

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:17.759
Got it.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.600
Here, let me get you some more.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.920
Does it taste good?

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.319
Yes, you made it?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.999
Liar, it must have been Dad.

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:29.799
Come on.

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:31.319
Same thing.

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:33.750
Mine tastes better than Dad's anyway.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.440
Shen Minghui.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.680
Why are you still here?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.279
Where else would I go?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.920
I'm not going anywhere.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.799
Wherever my sister lives, I live too.

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:28.840
This card's broken.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.450
You'll have to take me upstairs.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.519
Your sister's resting upstairs.

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:33.479
Don't disturb her.

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:34.479
Fine.

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:36.279
When she wakes up,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.279
I'll take her home with me.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.239
Stop being unreasonable, alright?

00:21:41.239 --> 00:21:42.600
Who's being unreasonable?

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:44.440
Do you even know what this is?

00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:46.239
It's basically house arrest.

00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:47.600
My sister may be easygoing,

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.999
but I'm not.

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.799
If you keep treating
my family like strangers,

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.559
I might not be good at much,

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:55.319
but I can sure make your house restless.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.200
What are you trying to do?

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:01.479
Get a card.

00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:23.880
Ms. Shen.

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:25.440
Hello.

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:28.440
I have some good news for you.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.360
Jiao won second place
in her piano competition today.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.160
Thanks to your guidance.

00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:34.360
Not at all.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.799
She's naturally gifted.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.360
Ms. Shen, you look

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.160
a bit pale.

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:44.920
Haven't been resting well?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.719
I'm pregnant.

00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:49.519
What a coincidence.

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:51.680
I'm pregnant too.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.559
It's my second child.

00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:55.920
I haven't been

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:56.880
sleeping well either.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.160
Can't eat much either.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:22:59.999
Oh right.

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:02.120
You should register
at the People's Hospital.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.719
Ask for Dr. Li Jingzhe.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.440
He's young,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.799
and yes, a male doctor,

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:07.400
but still,

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.160
he's very professional.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.279
I'm seeing Dr. Li as well.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.479
That's such a coincidence.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.719
Ms. Shen.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.759
Don't you think we were

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.960
meant to meet?

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.640
How about this?

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:27.360
Since we both see Dr. Li Jingzhe

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.360
at the People's Hospital,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.920
why don't we go for checkups together

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.519
next time?

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:33.799
Alright.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.120
Sounds good.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:37.239
Then I won't keep you any longer.

00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:40.360
Bye.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.120
Zhidong.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160
Zhidong.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.519
Bring me another jar.

00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:50.960
Where is it?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.920
Under the cabinet.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.920
How many times have I said this?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.719
Make something I can take to work.

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:02.440
You always ignore me.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:06.600
It's not the same.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.279
Your second sister is pregnant.

00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:10.759
And now you are too?

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.239
You're spoiled.

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:13.759
When I was pregnant,
I didn't get this treatment.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.519
Zhixia's here.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.960
Zhang Hao's office gave out grapes,
they're very sweet.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.079
I'll wash them.

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:23.600
My eldest girl
is always the most thoughtful.

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:28.279
Zhixia.

00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:32.680
I've thought about it over and over.

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.079
That baby cannot be kept.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.840
I mean,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.799
Zhilu's baby cannot be kept.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.120
Zhilu is still young.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.160
How will she
ever find someone in the future?

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.519
Right?

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.519
And a child growing up without a father

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:52.400
is such a pity.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.799
Mom, that's not really your business.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.400
Why not?

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.239
Zhilu is my daughter.

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:02.239
It's only right for me
to care about her.

00:25:02.719 --> 00:25:04.360
She's still young.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.799
Her life has just begun.

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:07.200
If she raises a child alone now...

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.719
Mom, her name isn't Zhilu.

00:25:08.719 --> 00:25:10.039
It's Shen Mingzhu.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.039
Whatever you call her.

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.319
That's not important.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.120
Anyway,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.360
what I mean is,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.039
given her situation right now,

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:19.920
right?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.920
Someone needs to talk to her
and help her decide.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:27.920
I think,

00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:29.719
Zhixia,

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:32.120
you should talk to her.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.799
Try to make her understand, alright?

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:37.479
Mom, let me repeat this.

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.079
Her name isn't Zhilu.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.479
It's Shen Mingzhu.

00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:43.160
She has her own parents,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.039
her own brother,

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:45.079
and her own life.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.920
What position am I in,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.680
what right do I have,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.680
to interfere in her life?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.519
Zhixia.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.759
These grapes are really sweet.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:25:59.360
She...

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.559
Here, take this.

00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:10.920
This one.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.860
Give it to your sister.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.279
This one's for you.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:14.920
Thanks, Mom.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.559
Zhilu.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.640
Mom, I just started
talking to her again.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.840
If I give it to her now,
do you think she'd even eat it?

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:22.759
She…

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:24.160
Zhixia.

00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:26.559
Why don't you use a delivery service?

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.759
Send it under Jiao's name.

00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:29.950
Wouldn't that mean she has to…

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.759
Son, that's a good idea.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.759
Use Jiao's name.

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:35.440
That's clever.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.060
Let your son deliver it, not my concern.

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:40.920
What does it have to do with me?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.799
Zhixia.

00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:14.960
I received the pickled mustard you sent.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.719
Please thank your mother for me.

00:27:16.719 --> 00:27:17.710
That was very thoughtful.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.640
Mingzhu.

00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:24.319
Mrs. Feng.

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:26.719
What's that smell?

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.999
A friend sent me this.

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:30.079
It's pickled mustard.

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:31.600
Her mother made it herself.

00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:33.160
Mingzhu,

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.279
this kind of food

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:36.799
should never enter our home.

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:39.640
It contains a lot of nitrites.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.680
It's not good for your health at all.

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:43.559
Who sent it? What kind of friend?

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.880
What was she thinking?

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.559
Doesn't she know you're pregnant?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.559
No, you can't eat that.

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:49.559
Throw it away.

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:50.600
But…

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.920
It's fine if I just have
a little once in a while.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.719
Absolutely not.

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:55.920
This.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.440
You're welcome.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.759
Let me know when you finish it.

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:05.920
I'll ask my Mom to make more.

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:08.799
Mingzhu,

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.200
you're pregnant now.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.559
Stop using your phone so much.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:13.360
The radiation is strong.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.120
It's bad for the baby's health.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.319
I'll hold on to your phone for you.

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:18.960
I'll call you if someone phones.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.600
Also,

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.400
I made this tremella soup
especially for you.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.960
I even asked Madam Mao
to add donkey-hide gelatin.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.999
It's very nutritious.

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:29.920
Go ahead, eat it.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.239
Thank you, Mrs. Feng.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.239
Eat it.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.799
Oh, right.

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:37.239
I'm taking this with me.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:42.559
Ms. Mao.

00:28:46.999 --> 00:28:47.640
Coming.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.279
Throw this away.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.200
She really take everything home.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.039
Sister.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.279
Liya's here.

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:58.279
I brought
some sea cucumbers for Mingzhu.

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:00.079
Wild ones, one-hundred-head grade.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.640
Nice.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.950
Thanks. Great for a pregnant woman.

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:03.559
- Ms. Mao.
- I'm worn out.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.440
Coming.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.160
Come in.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.200
Take this over there.

00:29:06.319 --> 00:29:07.680
Start with twenty.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.079
Alright.

00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:10.279
Pour Liya some tea.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:10.920
Okay.

00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:13.559
- Thanks.
- You look good.

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:15.680
No need to thank me.

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:16.840
Sister.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.680
How's it going?

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:20.319
Has Mingzhu decided

00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:21.640
to keep the baby?

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.200
No. She hasn't said anything yet.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.600
Cornual pregnancy.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.880
The baby might not make it.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.479
That's just an excuse.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.160
She wants you to transfer the flat

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.640
to her name first.

00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:38.200
Why would she?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.680
People like that never act for free.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.039
They always play tricks.

00:29:43.719 --> 00:29:44.519
If that's true,

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:46.880
then it's simple.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.799
Just transfer it to Mingzhu.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:51.079
After all,

00:29:51.079 --> 00:29:52.799
it's for her and the baby anyway.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.880
Before you do that,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.799
let her take a paternity test.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.600
Why?

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.039
Young people are careless now.

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:03.840
What if it's not Jianqi's child?

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920
Don't get it wrong.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.880
Don't talk nonsense.

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:07.920
It's definitely Jianqi's baby.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.039
What's the big deal?

00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:11.519
Just follow procedure. Right?

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.640
Do a paternity test.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.799
Have the baby, transfer the flat.

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:15.920
That's how it should be.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.039
What are you talking about?

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:19.160
You're confusing me completely.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.920
That's impossible.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.519
I'm telling you, stop saying nonsense.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:23.120
The baby is Jianqi's.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.519
I trust Mingzhu.

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:27.559
- This is about a person's character.
- Don't talk nonsense.

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.600
I'm just saying,
better be safe than sorry.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.360
You never know.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.239
Stop it already, you're too much.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.200
Mingzhu.

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:36.640
I...

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.200
I just need to follow procedure, right?

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.559
The flat is really meant to be yours.

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:43.550
Isn't that right, sister?

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.559
Mingzhu.

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:45.650
Don't take it the wrong way.

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:46.799
I didn't.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.160
Mrs. Feng.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.039
Give me my phone.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.600
I need some air.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:02.680
Sure, sure.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.960
Go downstairs for a walk.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.160
It's good for the baby.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.799
Mingzhu, phones have too much radiation.

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:08.840
It's not good for the baby.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.479
If I'm afraid of radiation,

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:13.120
how can I be a single mother?

00:31:29.479 --> 00:31:30.440
Take it slow.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.519
Mingzhu.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.319
Mingzhu.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:43.799
Mingzhu.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.120
Where are you going?

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120
I'll walk with you.

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:48.440
No need. I want to be alone.

00:31:48.719 --> 00:31:49.840
You're pregnant.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.600
It's not safe alone.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.279
We'll worry, won't we?

00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:53.079
Auntie.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.880
If someone watched you all day,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.940
would you feel comfortable?

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.799
I'm not watching you.

00:31:57.799 --> 00:31:58.840
I'm just worried about you.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.680
Worried about me,

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.680
or about the baby inside me?

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.039
If it weren't for this baby,

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:04.600
would we even be in touch now?

00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:06.960
Watch your mouth, young lady.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.440
Don't be so rude.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:10.279
What's right and what's rude?

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.120
Who are you?

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.160
I'm Mingzhu's friend.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.640
An expert in telling right from wrong.

00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:17.640
Being kind and respectful is right.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.880
Pretending to care while trying

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.759
to control someone,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.120
that's plain wrong.

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:23.680
Mingzhu, get in the car.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:26.519
Don't worry, Auntie.

00:32:26.719 --> 00:32:27.960
I'll take good care of myself.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.319
Sit tight.

00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:34.559
Be careful.

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:35.239
We're off.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.200
Where's Mingzhu?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.880
She went out with her friend.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.600
Where to?

00:32:52.719 --> 00:32:53.559
How would I know?

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:55.160
Sister.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.799
Your daughter-in-law is something else.

00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:58.120
You can't control her.

00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:00.799
Don't give her that flat so easily.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.360
Did you hear me?

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.479
Goodness.

00:33:08.479 --> 00:33:10.239
You've got a queen living in your house.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.479
Having a baby is a serious matter.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.079
Exactly. Once the baby's born,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.840
there's no father.

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:17.719
And I'll be tied to that family

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:18.920
for the rest of my life.

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:21.440
Would that really be good for the baby?

00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:22.960
When I was little,

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.279
my parents fought
all the time and nearly divorced.

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:27.120
Sometimes I didn't even get to eat.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.640
I hated it so much.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.279
I wondered why they even had me.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.960
But now I've grown up.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.479
I run my own shop and make money.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.759
I go wherever I want.

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:37.120
I do whatever I want.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.840
I don't need to please anyone.

00:33:39.239 --> 00:33:41.440
Now I think it's not so bad

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:42.400
to be alive.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.039
I'm glad
they brought me into this world.

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:46.960
Ni.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.519
If I don't rely on his family,

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.440
and raise the baby on my own,

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:54.440
can I really do it?

00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:57.710
That depends on
how you plan to raise him.

00:33:57.759 --> 00:34:00.239
Will it be breastfeeding,
wearing Xiaoni's old clothes,

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:03.200
or imported formula
and designer outfits?

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.880
Either way, he'll grow up fine.

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:06.680
You know that's not what I meant.

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:08.600
Get to the point.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.360
Alright, here's the point.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.920
I know you truly loved Jianqi.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.279
You both really loved each other.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.559
That's why deep down,

00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:18.800
you want to keep his child,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.079
to continue that love.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.119
But listen,

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:21.960
being pregnant

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.599
starts with love,

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.479
but now it's no longer about love.

00:34:27.039 --> 00:34:28.960
You have to face reality.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.880
Do you really want to have this baby?

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.840
Why do you want to have this baby?

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.400
Do you have the means

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.960
to give him a good life

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.840
and education?

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:39.320
Are you mature enough

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.800
to be a good mother?

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.519
Forget what anyone else says.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.559
It may look like a family matter,

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:46.400
a group matter,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.079
but in the end,

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:48.920
it's only your decision.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.039
Life isn't a textbook.

00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:51.999
There's no right answer.

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:54.280
You have to decide for yourself.

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:56.360
No one can force you

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.400
to have this baby.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.400
And no one can stop you

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.360
from having this baby.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.159
Hold that for me.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.199
Dad, do you still need
to press it down if it's non-slip?

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:24.920
Well, you see...

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.320
The non-slip part's on top.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.440
What about underneath?

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.199
You handle it.

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:29.960
Line it up with the seam.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.559
Which one?

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.800
The floor seam.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.440
Got it.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.960
Good.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.360
This cotton's freshly fluffed.
It's so warm.

00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:47.039
I told you to buy one that fits.

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:47.679
But no,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.199
you had to bring it back
and make it yourself.

00:35:50.199 --> 00:35:51.039
Such trouble.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.360
You always talk like that.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.440
How could anything fit you better?

00:35:55.519 --> 00:35:56.760
It's just right.

00:35:57.159 --> 00:35:59.320
You always
make the best use of everything.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.360
This side isn't slippery.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.920
Do you need to cover that side too?

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.920
No need, Dad.

00:36:06.039 --> 00:36:07.479
Does she get out of bed from here?

00:36:07.479 --> 00:36:08.720
Then I'll just cut from here.

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:09.920
Alright.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.760
Okay.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.360
Mom.

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:14.260
Did you give it to your sister?

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.400
Yes.

00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:17.070
Did you give it to her yet?

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.490
- I'll give it later.
- It will be like this.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.840
It's not slippery at all now.

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:21.639
Let's go.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.440
Get up. Why are you
wearing shoes on the mat?

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.999
It's a non-slip mat.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.039
You don't need it over there.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:28.360
Mingzhu, have an orange.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.039
It's all for you.

00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:34.280
We're heading out.

00:36:37.479 --> 00:36:39.440
That's better. Not slippery anymore.

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:43.199
Mom.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.519
What is it?

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.920
Can you sleep with me tonight?

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.559
Of course.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.280
Just like when you were little.

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:05.320
You always held my hand to sleep.

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:10.840
Sometimes I thought you were asleep.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.599
I'd pull my hand away.

00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:14.760
Then you'd mumble, "Mom,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.479
hand."

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.039
Mom.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.679
Why are you so good to me?

00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:26.760
Silly girl, I'm your mom.

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:30.559
Didn't you and Dad adopt me?

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.039
Love means more than blood, my child.

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:37.039
Look at Ni's mom.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:40.559
The way she treats her cat.

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:43.240
She's always holding it,

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.679
and feeding it too.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.880
Was that cat born to her?

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.320
Sometimes,

00:37:54.479 --> 00:37:56.199
when we're having dinner,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.400
I look at you and Minghui.

00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:02.199
You poke at the food here,
grab at it there.

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:04.039
You two fight over bites.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.840
It makes me so happy.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.679
I feel my life

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.840
is already complete.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.800
I just feel so happy.

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:18.240
No matter how hard it's been,
it's all been worth it.

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:21.479
You and Dad treat me so well.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:23.240
Minghui gets jealous.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.800
He grabs whatever I take.

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:27.479
If I'd known he'd be this naughty,

00:38:27.479 --> 00:38:28.750
I'd have stopped him being born.

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:31.240
Watch your mouth.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.559
Sweetheart.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.440
That...

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.320
Your dad told me not to nag. He said,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.999
whether to keep the baby

00:38:47.999 --> 00:38:49.039
is up to you.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.280
But I just want to tell you this.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.760
Forget whether
the Feng family has money,

00:38:58.119 --> 00:39:00.840
or whether they'll help later.

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:03.840
As long as you decide to keep it,

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.039
I'll help you raise it.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.920
I will help too.

00:39:11.159 --> 00:39:12.960
Shen Minghui, go to bed right now.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.840
No rush.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.760
Take your time.
There's still time to think.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.920
What's all the fuss this early?

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.240
Didn't you say Mingzhu's going to work?

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.950
I'm cooking her
a couple of dishes to take.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.159
The number of occupied rooms each day

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:12.840
must be checked again and again.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.760
There can't be any mistakes.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.320
This one...

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.159
Mingzhu.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.800
Mingzhu.

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:19.679
Why are you here?

00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:20.570
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mingzhu.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.940
What are you doing here?

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280
I'm here for work.

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:25.280
Nonsense. Work?

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.519
You're pregnant now.

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:28.559
And with everything
that's happened at home,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.960
take another month off.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.999
Go home and rest.

00:40:32.519 --> 00:40:33.280
A month?

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:34.559
What about it?

00:40:35.479 --> 00:40:38.039
Will that be personal leave
or sick leave?

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:40.159
Do I need to bring a doctor's note?

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:41.199
No need.

00:40:41.559 --> 00:40:42.559
No matter what,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.800
our team here

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.479
still stands for loyalty and care.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.960
And don't forget, your father-in-law
has always looked after us.

00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:51.199
Alright, go home and rest.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.960
Eat well and sleep well.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.680
That's the most important job
you have now.

00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:55.760
Go on.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.559
I'll head off then, Mr. Zhao.

00:40:58.679 --> 00:40:59.639
Go on.

00:41:02.479 --> 00:41:03.800
She's pregnant now.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.079
You're both busy running the business.

00:41:05.079 --> 00:41:06.390
No one's there to look after her.

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:07.679
I can't help worrying.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.960
She has to come back home.

00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:10.679
No.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.999
I'll call her first.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.400
Look at that.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.280
She's not even their own child...

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:17.880
Enough.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.039
I'm heading to the office.

00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:21.679
Feng.

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.199
Everything's in chaos now.

00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:24.159
Why aren't you doing anything?

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:26.199
You're always running off somewhere.

00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:28.559
Really...

00:41:33.519 --> 00:41:34.320
Sorry.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.559
The number
you have dialed is unavailable.

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:39.199
Meiqi.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.039
What?

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.760
Meiqi.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.720
Quick.

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:45.199
You

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.880
use your phone to call Mingzhu.

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:50.679
I tried mine.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.880
It won't go through.

00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:53.960
See if she's blocked me.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.400
You can't
keep controlling Mingzhu like this.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.840
What do you mean controlling her?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.440
She's carrying
your brother Jianqi's child.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.559
Your brother's gone now.

00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:02.880
I must protect his bloodline.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.039
That's not up to you.

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:05.039
Or to me.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.559
Mingzhu decides for herself.

00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:07.960
It's her right to choose.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.240
What about your brother then?

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.130
Just because Jianqi's gone,
he loses his right to be a father?

00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:13.360
In theory, yes.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.320
What kind of theory is that?

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.039
Jianqi died saving someone,
you know that?

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:20.039
He was a hero, a true hero.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.039
And now his death means nothing?

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:24.360
He can't even be a father anymore?

00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:25.559
Does that mean

00:42:25.559 --> 00:42:26.880
he's no longer part of this world?

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.760
Of course no.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.159
He still has us.

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:31.240
No.

00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:32.679
Call her.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.479
I won't.

00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:34.880
- Will you call her?
- No.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880
Will you?

00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:38.960
You're driving me mad.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.920
Feng Jianqi!

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.320
I'm Feng Meiqi!
