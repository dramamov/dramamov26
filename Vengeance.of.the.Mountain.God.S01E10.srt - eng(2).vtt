Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.680
Wake up.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.920
Wake up.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.120
Wake up.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.920
It's me. Don't— Don't come closer.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.760
It's me. It's me.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.840
You're safe now.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.680
You're safe.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.520
Jin Shisan.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.080
It's me.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.640
It's all right now.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.480
It's all right.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.160
This is the southern slope
of Changbai Mountain.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.640
Hardly anyone comes here.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.960
There's a heavy chill here.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480
You must've fallen into
the Phantom Maze.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.960
That's why you couldn't get out.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.640
So you entered the mountain
from the southern slope.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.800
You really don't take
the usual path.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080
Looks like you found
the Great Ginseng.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.880
No wonder you're the Second Young Lady
of the Yang Family.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.560
You found the Great Ginseng
so quickly.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.560
I don't want to lose to you.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.200
I'm not here for victory or defeat.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.800
I'm after the truth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.760
The truth.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.520
Winners rule, losers are outcasts.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.960
In this world, it's always
the winner who decides.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.600
Whatever the winner says—

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.960
—that becomes the truth.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.240
If that's how it is,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.240
I have to compete with
Second Young Lady Yang.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.600
Take this path in a bit.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880
It's relatively safer.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.320
Remember to mark your trail.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.520
So they can find you.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.520
Don't go alone anymore.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.880
You too.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.080
Take care of yourself.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.080
We've searched all morning.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.680
Haven't even seen a trace
of ginseng.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
You think digging for ginseng

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.080
is that easy?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.680
Not just a morning—

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800
even ten days or half a month
without luck

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880
is pretty common.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.240
The terrain here is different
from the west and north slopes.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.160
It's not the same.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960
It's the Descending Dragon Formation.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
The peaks on both sides rise and fall.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.960
You enter through the narrow
wind gap in the middle.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.400
It's like entering a grand hall.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.600
Rein in the horses, raise the flag.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.080
This kind of terrain

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.880
is best for storing wind
and gathering energy.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.440
The closer to the wind gap,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.320
the closer to the energy point.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.600
Our chances of finding
the Great Ginseng increase.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.400
We need to find the energy point first.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.520
Then we can narrow the search area.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.960
Jin's right.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.960
This is definitely
the Descending Dragon Formation.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.320
But where is the energy point?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.680
I haven't found it either.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.880
Let's keep looking.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.080
Let's go.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.320
Ginseng.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.320
What kind?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.520
What— What kind?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.440
Idiot.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.240
You're joining the mountain.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.800
You need to say how many leaves.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.160
Careful.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.080
You're blasting the mountain.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.160
Hurry and bow to the Lord of the Mountain
to apologize.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.600
This isn't ginseng,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.080
but it's still a small one.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.520
Doesn't count as blasting the mountain.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.160
Careful.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.600
Hurry and bow to the Lord of the Mountain.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.320
Not to apologize.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.080
It's to give thanks.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.040
Quick.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.960
Come.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.320
Wait.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.960
Don't you think something's off
about this place?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.560
The soil is fine.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
It's brown-black.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.840
Mixed with dead branches and leaves.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.720
Three forks, five leaves.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.320
Facing away from the sun,
toward the shade.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.400
Seeking me.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.120
Linden trees nearby.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.960
Can't be wrong.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.560
There's likely Great Ginseng
hidden here.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.720
I did tie this just now.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.400
No.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.440
Even in broad daylight,
we hit a Spirit Wall.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.880
We've marked trails and tied red strings
all the way.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.600
How are we still mountain disoriented?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.520
Shisan.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.840
The first lesson of Geomantic Vision
is reading the energy.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.520
The "Li Wei: Dou Wei Yi" says—

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.720
When the ruler rides wood,
ginseng grows for the king.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.960
Ginseng below.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080
Purple energy above.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.720
This century-old mountain ginseng

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.400
is the king of all plants.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.400
Naturally, it has royal energy.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.720
That's the purple energy.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720
Don't get separated, everyone.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.560
Follow me.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.280
Let's go.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.600
Brother Shisan.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.560
Look.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.880
Up ahead should be
the Azure Dragon Ridge.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.960
Be careful.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.000
What a small world for rivals.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.840
Should've checked the almanac today.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.560
No wonder I stepped in crap.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.000
Saw your sorry tail.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.840
Now I get it.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.960
Who do you think you are?

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.400
How dare you talk to Young Master Yang like that?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.280
If I didn't have a rule against hitting women, I—

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.840
And who the hell are you?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.280
You think you can hit my brother?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.000
You—

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
Uh, Boss Jin—

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.080
Young Master Yang—

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.520
Let's talk this out calmly.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.400
Eunhee—

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.840
Why are you with them?

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.400
Shut up.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840
I'm not as dumb as you.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.720
I'm just a wise bird choosing the right tree.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.120
What wise bird?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.080
Guess she's a hot one then.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.280
I mean, Young Master Yang is so suave,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.000
bringing these two birds to the mountain.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.400
Say that again.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.720
Young Master Yang—

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.080
If you fire a gun here,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400
and blood is spilled,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.000
you'll anger the Lord of the Mountain.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.120
Then no one will find the Great Ginseng.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.680
Young Master Yang just wants this forest.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.520
Let me, Jin Shisan,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.560
show respect to Eighth and Ninth Masters today.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.440
I'll let you have this forest.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.720
Boss Jin, what are you saying?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.120
Ninth Master always follows the rules.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.560
The ginseng guild's rules—

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.240
First into the forest gets priority.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.520
The rest must yield.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.000
Since Boss Jin entered first today,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.840
the forest should go to Boss Jin.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.400
We're leaving.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.560
The mark left by that girl, Ruyi,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.840
points right to this forest.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.720
Now Jin Shisan is here.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.280
There must be Great Ginseng.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.560
Why give it to them?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.720
Just do as I say.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.120
Fall back.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.080
At least you know your place.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.560
No idea what that woman

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.840
is really up to.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.560
Doesn't matter.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.560
Haiyue—

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.280
Let me see your wound.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.120
Does it hurt?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.080
Move aside.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.560
You get hit and don't even fight back.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.880
I always have to protect you.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.240
And another thing—

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.120
How could you talk about my sister like that?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.400
So what should I do?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.000
Did I offend our sister?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.840
What do you mean, "our" sister?

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.240
She's not yours.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.680
We're heading to Azure Dragon Ridge.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.760
We'll set up camp there.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.160
Jinzi—

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.520
Do you think tomorrow

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.720
we can find the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.720
We're right across from it.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.400
You mean—

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.280
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is opposite Azure Dragon Ridge?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:19.960
That's right.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.600
I checked it out during the day.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.720
This forest,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.960
and the plants on this cliff,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.080
all bow toward the opposite cliff.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.840
My father once said,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.920
the key to picking ginseng is reading the terrain.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.920
You observe the plants' posture.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.160
A century-old ginseng is king of all plants.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.520
When it appears,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.040
the surrounding plants

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.160
bend toward it as the center.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.040
It's like they're paying homage.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.360
There's a saying for this.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.960
It's called Homage of the Forest.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.480
That cliff is huge.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.720
How do we know

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.840
where the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is hidden?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.360
On that cliff,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.600
there must be a hidden cave.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.280
If we find the entrance,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.600
how do we get in?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720
The only way is to gather vines,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.400
braid them into a long rope and tie it on.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.360
Then descend along the cliff.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.160
No way.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.160
It's too dangerous.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.720
What if the cave is too deep?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.080
What if the vine snaps?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.720
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is right there.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.280
For my father,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.600
I'd risk even the King of Hell's palace.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.400
Brother Jinzi—

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.720
I'll go with you tomorrow.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.400
No need.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.040
You guys wait here and cover me.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600
The mantis stalks the cicada,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040
but the oriole waits behind.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.400
Yang Tingxuan and his crew must be nearby.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.600
Jin Shisan—

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.040
I've found the century-old ginseng's location.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.040
Did you find it too?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.600
The book "Spring and Autumn Destiny Pivot" says,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.160
the Yaoguang star scatters and becomes ginseng.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.280
If the ruler neglects the mountain's bounty,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.080
the Yaoguang star dims.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040
No ginseng will grow.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.720
This Yaoguang star

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.720
is one of the Big Dipper's seven stars.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.080
If Yaoguang is dim,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.360
it's hard for ginseng to appear.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.520
If Yaoguang shines bright,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.720
ginseng will surely grow.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.080
Dad, look—

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.400
Dad—

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:27.960
Dad—

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.600
Dad—

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.160
Dad—

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.280
Two and nine are the feet.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.360
Dad—

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.920
You're still alive!

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.280
Dad—

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.400
You called on the spirits behind my back again.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.400
Open!

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.840
The door's blocked.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.600
It won't open.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.160
Right.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.920
It won't budge.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.080
Why is there blood? There's blood!

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:11.840
Dad—

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.640
Hurry, go!

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.400
First Immortal: Gold.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.160
Second Immortal: Silver.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.720
Third Immortal brings the treasure bowl.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.080
Fourth Immortal plants the longevity tree.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.520
Fifth Immortal nurtures the thousand-year ginseng.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.360
Who's there?

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.280
This is poisonous.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.600
I can't move.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.600
Father, how can I save you?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.040
I can't move.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.840
Go!

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.720
Who are you?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.080
Why are you trying to harm us?

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.280
No!

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.400
Old Jin.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.200
Uncle.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.520
Father.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.720
Jin Shisan.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960
Jin Shisan, wake up!

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.720
Jin Shisan.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.720
Father.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.600
Father.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.280
Father.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:24.960
Jin Shisan, Father.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.280
Jin Shisan, Jin Shisan.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:27.840
It's all right now.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.400
It's all right now.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.840
It's all right now.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.960
I saw my father.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.520
And Uncle Lizhong.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.160
Someone wants to kill them.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.080
Jin Shisan.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.880
You might have fallen into a mountain formation.
