=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.740
=Episode 4=

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.360
Morning, uncle.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.520
Jianqi.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.080
Go ahead.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.540
It's fine.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.360
I'm good, Jianqi.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.319
You go ahead and brush.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.360
I'll wait for you.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.440
No need, Jianqi.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Come.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520
Here.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.919
Please, Jianqi.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.119
Please.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.839
Go ahead, brush.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.199
Here, I'll hold it for you.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.479
No, that's fine.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.839
You brush.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.240
Shen Minghui.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.650
The sun must be rising
in the west today.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.119
Jianqi.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.759
You're such a straight guy.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.880
A solid one.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.479
I almost want to marry you.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.240
That… That's not necessary.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.399
No need.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.399
Keep brushing.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640
I'll leave you to it.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.800
Suit yourself.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.800
Call me if you need anything, Jianqi.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.399
See you later.

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:45.999
Jianqi, breakfast's ready.

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:47.480
Coming.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.480
Where are Mom and Dad?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.719
They went grocery shopping.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.250
We've got an ultrasound
appointment this afternoon.

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.360
No need to pick me up.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.920
We'll meet at the hospital.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.480
Okay.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.439
Jianqi.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:05.599
Here.

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.360
Drink it on your way to work.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:13.439
Mingzhu.

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.279
Your brother's
being unusually friendly today.

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.240
He's not up to something again, is he?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.360
I'm a little worried.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.559
I guess no.

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.879
Just use last night's energy
to put him in his place.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.999
(Parking lot)

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:31.679
Maodou.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.320
Although this company makes liquor,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.999
its style is actually very clear-headed.

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.200
So the two of us

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.439
need to stay composed.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.399
No exaggerating.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.119
Now you're making me nervous.

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.559
If we don't hype it up,
how do we get the ad deal?

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.240
You're missing my point again.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.279
Not no hype,

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.999
but measured hype.

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:50.640
Learn well.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.760
Keep improving.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.480
Zhixia, you okay?

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.679
I'll find a store nearby, get you some
water from a supermarket or something.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.480
No need.

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:11.679
Work comes first.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.279
Slow down, Zhixia.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.839
I'm fine.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:41.919
Hello.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.640
Hello.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.719
Are you Mr. Lu?

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.279
Hello, let me introduce myself.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.239
I'm Xu Zhixia.

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm an editor at the supplement
of the Nanzhou Daily.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.239
Do you have a moment to talk?

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:56.159
Please, have a seat.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.120
Here's the thing, Mr. Lu.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.799
I used to be an editor.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.760
Later, I started my own public account

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.039
called "Zhixia Speaks."

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.080
We focus on women's self-growth.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.760
Currently, we have
over 200,000 followers.

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.239
And three local communities.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.200
Our offline events

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.279
are always quite popular.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.520
I'm in the liquor business.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.479
You just mentioned that Zhixia...

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.320
"Zhixia Speaks."

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.880
That's aimed at women, right?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.159
So where exactly do we overlap?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.080
Women drink liquor too.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.399
And when men drink,

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.080
don't they often

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.440
have to check in with their wives

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.000
or girlfriends first?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.520
That's true.

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.120
My dad's liquor is all bought by my mom.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.960
In most households,
women manage the money.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.159
So they care more about quality.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.159
Exactly. My mom always says

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.080
the liquor she buys for my dad

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.839
is all pure grain liquor.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.919
Pure grain, huh?

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.719
That's exactly what we produce.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.320
That's why we're here today,
to pay our respects.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.279
I actually did a survey at our company.

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:04.670
Across all departments,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.279
it's always the moms who buy the liquor
and the dads who drink it.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.050
That's why we have confidence today

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.960
to sit here
and talk about advertising with you.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.239
Even in my family,

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.950
my mom decides
what liquor my dad drinks.

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:21.719
The Past and Present of Rufeng Liquor.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:22.700
(Project Proposal)

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.520
I like this concept.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.860
Here's what we'll do.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.200
Let's start with fifty thousand yuan
and see how it goes.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.880
How's that sound?

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.839
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Lu.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.279
But just to be clear,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.000
the article must be well written.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.960
Liquor is culture, after all.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.110
Please rest assured, Mr. Lu.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.640
Your company's article
will be written entirely by me.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.159
I'll go there myself,

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.880
and write every word by myself.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.440
Good.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.450
Pleasure working with you, Mr. Lu.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.719
"Don't worry.

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.640
Your company's article
will be written entirely by me.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.239
You know, in our company..."

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:02.960
Zhixia, in our company,
there's literally just the two of us.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.440
But you managed to hyped it up
like it's a Fortune 500 company.

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:06.520
Almost there.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.960
That's how
Fortune 500 company get started.

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:11.680
Go back and organize all the info

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.399
and reviews

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:13.560
about Rufeng Liquor.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.440
I'll turn them
into a Fortune 500 story first.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.520
No problem.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.719
Zhixia, you're gonna throw up again?

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:24.120
It's fine. I swallowed it back.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.000
Haven't even decided whether to keep it,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.910
and this little one's
already giving me trouble.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.159
Why wouldn't you keep it?

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:32.960
You gonna raise it?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.719
Zhixia.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.919
Look at all these ribs.

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:39.960
That's a lot of ribs.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.919
- And bamboo shoots too.
- And bamboo shoots too.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.640
I brought two pieces of ribs today.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.000
But I'm afraid
I can't share them this time.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:55.799
So stingy.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.760
- You've got so much there.
- Yeah, don't be so cheap.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.039
It's not about being stingy.

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:01.279
My brother-in-law

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.919
packed this lunch box.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.120
There could even be

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200
a laxative in there.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.560
That's fine, I'm not scared.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.239
Here, have some of mine.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:09.940
Come on, everyone.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.320
Grab some food over here.

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:14.560
Here.

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:16.359
Eat mine, go ahead.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.399
- Tastes amazing.
- Really good.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:21.760
You're all ready to die for food, huh?

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.680
Shen Mingzhu.

00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:44.040
Mrs. Feng.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.599
I'd like a word with you.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.759
I'm working right now.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:48.999
Then I'll keep it brief.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:52.560
Your Nanxi Hotel
is really disappointing.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.879
No air conditioning at all.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.040
How can you compete
with Xincheng Hotel like this?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.560
Go assign the rooms first.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.440
I'll be right there.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.800
Okay.

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:06.759
Sit down.

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:09.680
No need, I still have work to finish.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.879
I took the car back.

00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:15.239
I paid for it, so that's only fair.

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.519
That watch looks expensive.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.560
Feng Jianqi bought it
for you, didn't he?

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:23.320
Are you taking it back too?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.440
No, that's not necessary.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.280
You can keep it.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.160
I came to see you today
because I wanted to tell you something.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.639
Our Feng Jianqi

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.680
has been spoiled since he was a child.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.920
He's used to wearing
designer brands everywhere he goes.

00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:37.119
Now that he's moved into your old house

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:38.800
and is even riding a shared bike,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.639
the novelty will only last a few days.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.560
Soon he'll realize
how uncomfortable it is.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.920
You don't believe me?

00:09:44.359 --> 00:09:45.519
I wouldn't know.

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.639
Of course you don't.

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:51.040
Families like ours

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:54.239
can't help it,
we simply have too much wealth.

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:57.639
Jianqi moving into your place

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.040
is nothing more
than a little exercise in humility.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.999
Do you really think, in the end,

00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:04.239
he would choose you or me?

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:06.680
Mrs. Feng,

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:08.359
you're Jianqi's mother.

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.119
And I'm the mother of Jianqi's child.

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:11.759
If you make him choose,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.360
you'll only make things harder for him.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.080
You stubborn girl,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.479
why won't you listen to reason?

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:18.759
Didn't you hear
a single word I just said?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.280
Fine, have it your way.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:24.320
Tell Feng Jianqi, he doesn't
need to feel torn anymore.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.479
And tell his father

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:26.999
to stop trying to persuade me.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.639
I'm done with this son.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:30.879
And his son, he has nothing
to do with me either.

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.359
You can both live your own lives.

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:43.719
Unlocking successful.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.879
To lock and return,
please operate through the app.

00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:03.400
Jianqi, where are you?

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.730
I'm waiting for you at the outside
of the ultrasound room.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.160
Number 32, Shen Mingzhu,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.680
please go to examination room nine.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.879
I'm already on my way.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:20.800
Wait for me, Mingzhu.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.359
The gestational sac
is visible in the uterine cavity,

00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:42.200
and we can see the embryo.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.759
The heartbeat is visible as well.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:44.719
The baby looks healthy.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.839
Help, somebody help!

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.440
Help!

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400
Help, please!

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.599
Someone, please help!

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.040
Hurry, help!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.999
Quick, help!

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.160
Help!

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.119
Hurry, save him.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:07.920
Save him.

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:10.400
Help him, sir, hurry.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.400
Save him, please.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.960
Help him, quick.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.639
Don't give up, stay with us.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.960
Come on.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.400
Hold on, faster, keep going.

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.759
Just a little longer.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.479
I'm sorry.

Hello, Yangyang?

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.999
Can you check for me,

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.359
is Jianqi still at the office?

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:50.119
He took the afternoon off

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:51.119
and left after lunch.

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:52.759
Thanks.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.080
Make way, please.

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:02.280
Move aside, everyone, move aside.

Jianqi was counting on you
to help with his child.

The Feng family has an heir.

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:05.800
Stay strong.

If you need to cry, just let it out.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.560
He was so young.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.560
It's a devastating blow
to his parents and family.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.999
The investigation
into his act of bravery

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:02.150
and the official recognition process
has begun, right?

00:15:03.479 --> 00:15:06.119
We also need to expedite
the compensation for the family.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.479
We'll make sure
everything is handled with care.

Meiqi.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.759
It's alright, Meiqi.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.719
Your brother was saving a child.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.080
He...

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.440
Jianqi was a hero.

Jianqi.

Jianqi was a hero.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.400
He earned great merit.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.560
Even in the next world,
he'll live a blessed life.

Mingzhu.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.239
Get up and rest for a bit.

00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:08.200
You'll wear yourself out like this.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.400
Don't forget, you're carrying a baby.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.639
Mom, you should go home first.

00:16:22.479 --> 00:16:23.800
I want to stay with Jianqi.

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.440
It's alright, I'll stay with you.

Mingzhu.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.119
Have some noodles.

00:17:05.639 --> 00:17:07.999
I know losing my brother
hurts you deeply.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.359
But you have to eat,
or your body won't hold up.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.519
Just a little, please.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.960
Your brother hasn't eaten yet either.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:21.920
My brother is gone.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.279
You'll always be my sister-in-law.

My sister is still young.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.440
Don't ruin her life.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.680
What did you say?

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:41.039
I said,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.319
why should my sister
always be your sister-in-law?

00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:45.440
Enough.

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:47.319
How dare you say that now?

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:02.519
Because they loved each other.

There's definitely nothing wrong.

00:18:57.239 --> 00:18:59.160
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

Jianqi was a swimming champion.

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:15.920
How could he possibly have drowned?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.600
He was a champion swimmer.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.799
He was excellent at it.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.840
How could he have drowned?

00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:27.600
Why?

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.239
Why did he have to die like that?

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:38.319
Feng Jianqi,
why did you go to the river?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.600
Why did you have to drown?

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:45.079
Our family has good genes.

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:46.440
There won't be any problems.

00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:49.840
The baby will be perfectly fine.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.920
Mom.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.759
Even though Brother was a great swimmer,

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.519
he wasn't a lifeguard.

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:14.319
He never learned rescue techniques.

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:20.400
Mingzhu will give birth to the baby.

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:24.239
When that child comes,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.279
we'll make sure
he never goes near the river.

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:29.279
I'll watch over him.

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:32.160
I'll follow him every day.

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:33.799
I'll keep an eye on him always.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.479
Mingzhu will have the baby, right?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.360
Mom, don't worry.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.319
She needs time to make her own decision.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.840
What's there to think about?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.810
There's no need to think.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.719
Our family has great genes.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.319
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.719
He was outstanding.

00:20:58.719 --> 00:20:59.600
I'm telling you,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.079
Jianqi's son will be just like him.

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:04.600
He'll be a swimming champion too.

Our genes are good.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.279
There won't be any problems.

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.559
The baby must be born.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.559
I'm telling you,
Jianqi was a swimming champion.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.759
His son will be a swimming champion too.

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:13.719
Our genes are good.

00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:14.680
There's no problem.

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:43.519
There's no one left
to pick me up anymore.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.559
The baby is inside me.

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.260
Whether to have it
or not is my decision.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.559
Alright.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.680
Before you make that decision,

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:05.440
you should also
think about the rest of the family.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.079
Listen to all sides before judging.

00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:10.680
I know, Mom.

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.759
Alright, I'll go now.

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:22.920
Mom, take it slow.

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.400
It's late.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.759
Why don't you take a cab home?

00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:26.479
Yes, Mom.

00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:27.160
Take a cab back.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160
A cab?

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.239
Your generation seems to have

00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:32.279
lost the virtue of thrift and frugality.

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:34.680
No wonder you can't afford kids.

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:39.279
Zhixia.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:41.479
No matter what you decide,

00:22:41.479 --> 00:22:42.120
remember this.

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:44.160
Don't stay up too late.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.400
Try to get some rest early.

00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:46.400
Okay.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.440
Mom.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.519
I'll think about it carefully.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.640
Take care.

00:23:01.479 --> 00:23:04.160
We should listen to what people think.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.160
Everyone seems to agree.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.279
Really, have the baby.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.519
Think about it, the baby chose us

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:11.640
to be its parents.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.999
Can you really turn it away?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.319
You think I don't want to keep it?

00:23:16.319 --> 00:23:18.079
But how would I raise it?

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:19.920
I'll raise it, I'll take care of it.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.020
Didn't I do a good job raising Jiao?

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.950
You can have as many
as you want, I'll handle it.

00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:26.960
If I do,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.039
this apartment
won't be big enough anymore.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.160
How about this,

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:32.999
get me a three-bedroom place,

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:34.340
and I'll have the baby right away.

00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:37.519
I don't think this is about the house.

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:39.600
We can just buy a bunk bed.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.400
Let Jiao share it with the baby.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.039
Exactly.

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:43.750
Or get a little carrier.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.079
Jiao can carry the baby to school.

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:46.279
Then we won't have to worry.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.540
That means I've made it in life.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.079
Mom.

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:51.719
Come sleep with me.

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:54.160
Hear that, "successful man"?

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.039
Ms. Xia, President Xu, boss.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:23:59.400
Mommy.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.559
Come sleep with me.

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.279
Coming.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.039
Coming.

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:09.160
My little troublemaker.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.160
Come here.

00:24:14.999 --> 00:24:16.920
Let me hold you while you sleep.

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:22.039
Mom.

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:24.160
If you have a new baby,

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:25.880
does that mean you won't

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.440
sleep cuddling me anymore?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.559
Who said that?

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.960
I can hold one with my left arm

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.279
and one with my right.

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:33.039
Right?

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.799
Then

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:36.640
what about me?

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.920
One on my left leg,

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.279
one on my right.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:41.960
How's that?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200
One is enough.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.400
Not enough.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.200
Enough, one's enough.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.719
Not enough, the more the better.

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:52.120
You two, stop arguing.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.519
The kid needs to sleep.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.440
Yeah, the kid needs to sleep.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.319
Daddy, out.

00:24:57.759 --> 00:24:58.440
Alright.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.880
I'm leaving, goodnight.

00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:08.680
Goodnight, Makka Pakka.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880
Go on, out.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.360
Mom.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.039
I agree you can have a baby.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.440
But I don't agree to getting a dog.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.999
Then let's just

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.519
have a baby instead.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.719
Raising a dog
isn't the same as raising a baby.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.160
It's the same.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600
We love them,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.319
and they'll love us back.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.559
Sweetheart,

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:41.200
go to sleep.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.559
Turn off the light.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.360
Goodnight, Mom.

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:53.640
Goodnight, my love.

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:54.920
I love you.

00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:57.039
Mommy loves you too.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.799
Don't listen to your father.

00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:03.759
Really, what do men know

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:05.160
about the pain of childbirth?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.600
The baby's already here,

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.039
how could we not want it?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.600
Worry about giving birth,
not raising the child.

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:13.079
That would be the same in any era.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.559
Think about it, the baby chose us

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:16.719
to be its parents.

00:26:16.719 --> 00:26:17.999
Can you really turn it away?

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:32.960
Today,

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.640
we invited our in-laws over

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.400
to discuss a few important matters.

00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:43.460
We'd like to set up a memorial
for Jianqi, in Mingzhu's name.

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:46.400
This is something
his mother and I both wish for.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.680
In-laws,

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.200
if you had such plans of your own,

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.640
why didn't you discuss them with us?

00:26:54.999 --> 00:26:58.160
She's still alive, and you're already
putting up a tombstone?

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.610
After all, they've already
registered their marriage,

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.719
so they're legally husband and wife.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.319
We just

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.319
don't want Mingzhu to forget Jianqi.

00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:11.440
That's not the point.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.759
You... Sure, they got
the marriage certificate,

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:15.479
but they never held a wedding, right?

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.460
Even the password to their home,

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.560
my daughter doesn't know it.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.120
And now you want her name
carved on the tombstone?

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.279
That doesn't seem right.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.640
Enough, stop arguing.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.999
Let the in-laws speak.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.400
Let's hear what else you've got in mind.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.319
We plan to transfer
the house to Mingzhu.

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:43.120
Mingzhu.

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:47.400
I know I was wrong
about many things before.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.479
I'm sorry. I owe you an apology.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.880
From now on,

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:56.400
please call me Mom.

00:28:06.759 --> 00:28:07.479
Mrs. Feng,

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.680
I never blamed you.

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:15.519
I know

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.920
you're upset with me.

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.079
I was the one who refused
to let you call me Mom before.

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:23.960
That must've hurt you.

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:27.799
I'm sorry.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.160
For Jianqi's sake,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.759
please keep the baby.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.319
If you have any conditions,
just tell us.

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:42.999
I don't have any.

00:28:45.479 --> 00:28:46.239
Mingzhu.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.440
The way Jianqi's mom
might've treated you before…

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.319
I hope you can understand her, alright?

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.600
Yes, it was all my fault.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.999
I think about this matter...

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:03.680
The baby's matter...

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.759
We should go back

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.200
and talk it over again.

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:12.239
Alright, fine.

00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:14.319
Then let's talk about the house.

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.279
I know you have concerns,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.880
and we understand that.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.519
About the house, I've already discussed it
with Jianqi's mother.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.519
As long as Mingzhu agrees,

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.440
we'll transfer Jianqi's apartment

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:32.479
to her name.

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:36.279
That home will belong to
Mingzhu and the child.

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:38.479
We'll live right across the street,

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.330
so we can help take care of them.

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.319
We'll cover all of Mingzhu
and the child's expenses

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:45.440
in the future.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.600
When the child is born,

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:52.680
we'll take care of school,
study abroad, even the wedding.

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:56.479
All of it will be our responsibility.

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:05.160
If you still have any concerns,

00:30:05.239 --> 00:30:06.479
we can draw up an agreement.

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.640
Jianqi's uncle is a lawyer.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.160
Yes, I'm a professional.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.319
So in the end, you just want my sister
to have the baby.

00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:19.559
What about my sister?

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.330
Have you thought about her?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.400
She's still so young.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.460
If she raises a child alone,
how will she remarry?

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:28.319
That's not the point right now.

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:29.279
Jianqi just passed away,

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:31.400
and you're already
talking about remarriage?

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.519
You invited us

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.239
here to talk

00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:37.039
about the child's future.

00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:38.360
And we...

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.039
We're just supposed
to sit here and listen to you?

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.360
Only you get to decide?

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:46.840
I will never remarry.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.239
Mingzhu, don't say things like that.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.960
You...

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:54.600
You're still young.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.079
Who knows what will happen later?

00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:57.360
Let's not talk so far ahead.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.519
She already said it clearly.

00:30:58.519 --> 00:30:59.840
Mingzhu won't remarry.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.160
Why do you keep insisting otherwise?

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:04.960
Mingzhu and Jianqi
truly loved each other.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.319
This child is the fruit of their love.

00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:09.999
And now that there's a "fruit of love,"

00:31:09.999 --> 00:31:11.039
who was it before who said

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.799
to divorce and abort the baby?

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:15.850
What's that supposed to mean?

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.799
You can push us around
just because my son's gone?

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:18.920
Enough, no one's bullying anyone.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.519
No one's being bullied.

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.250
Alright, everyone.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.840
We came to discuss things peacefully.

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:24.279
Let's not get too worked up.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.680
Because of Jianqi,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.999
and now because of his child,

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:31.759
we have already become one family.

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:33.960
Mr. Shen, you know this well.

00:31:37.759 --> 00:31:38.759
In our Feng family,

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:40.440
we only had one son.

00:31:41.479 --> 00:31:43.559
This child is the only heir

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.400
that Jianqi has left us.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.719
I hope you can understand.

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:49.759
I truly wish

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.479
that Mingzhu can keep the baby.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.200
But please rest assured,

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:57.600
we will never interfere in her future.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.079
And we will never

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.319
use the child to hold her back.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.880
If one day in the future,

00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:08.559
Mingzhu decides to remarry,

00:32:10.479 --> 00:32:11.519
I will understand

00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:12.960
and support her.

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:16.160
We will not interfere in any way.

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:22.759
Mingzhu,

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:25.440
now that Jianqi is gone,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.719
from this day on,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.840
you are our daughter.

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:34.319
We will treat you with care and respect.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.279
If one day you meet someone suitable,

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.600
we will proudly send you off

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.079
just like our own daughter.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.680
Please have the baby.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.880
I will help raise it.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.590
If you cannot
bear to part with the child,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.960
you may take the baby with you.

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:56.640
You can raise the child yourself.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.440
We only ask

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.840
that you let us see the child

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:03.600
from time to time.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.880
Mingzhu, please, I'm begging you.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.039
For Jianqi's sake,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.880
let us have something
to remember him by.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.200
Will you?

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.880
Have the baby.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.799
Everything else can be discussed.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.719
Whatever you ask for,
we will agree to it.

00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:23.759
I promise.

00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:25.160
Please have the baby.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.680
Everything can be worked out.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.039
We can talk about anything, alright?

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:33.759
Mingzhu,

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.799
the child belongs to Jianqi,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.319
but it's also your own flesh and blood.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.200
That's right, Mingzhu.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.559
It's a life too, isn't it?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.960
Enough, all of you.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.719
Whether the baby is born or not

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.319
is my decision.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.920
Come eat.

00:34:07.239 --> 00:34:07.880
Zhang,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.840
this egg is too greasy.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.120
But that's your favorite,
the double-sided egg.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.160
From now on,
I'll only eat single-sided ones.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.840
Then I'll make
single-sided ones for you.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.679
From now on.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.479
Little Zhang,

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.479
this milk is too cold.

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:34.039
Warm it up for me.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.400
Dad,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.400
warm the milk for Mom.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.039
I want you to do it.

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:43.400
From this moment on, you need to learn
to take care of others.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.599
Why?

00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:48.880
Because you're about
to become a big sister.

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.199
So you've decided to have it?

00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:54.519
Agree?

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:57.199
Jiao, you're going to be a big sister.

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:59.440
From this moment on,

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.440
we'll take even better care
of Mom together.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.880
Zhang Service, at your service.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.520
Little Zhang Service,
reporting for duty.

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:08.720
Mom,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.400
from now on I'll sleep with the baby.

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:14.039
So, Madam, how's the massage pressure?

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:17.880
Shall we begin breakfast now?

00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:18.720
Excellent.

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:20.639
Fried egg.

00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:21.720
Milk.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.440
Uh...

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.390
- Where do we warm the milk?
- And where do we fry the eggs?

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.430
Where do we warm the milk?

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.400
Over there.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.720
Here, give it to me, I'll take it.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.479
Yes, grab a napkin.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.199
Where's the napkin?

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:32.479
The napkin is...

00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:33.639
Here, right here.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:34.999
Here.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:35.760
Got it.

00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:44.810
I need to feed you well
and keep you healthy,

00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:46.320
so when the baby is born,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.559
the baby will be healthy too.

00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:50.479
The doctor said

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:53.079
our baby is developing well.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.550
They already saw the gestational sac.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.559
Touch here.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.240
How could you bear to
leave me and the baby behind?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.679
Jianqi.

I don't think
she slept at all last night.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.360
I stood by her door a few times.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.159
She kept tossing and turning.

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:55.599
She has too much on her mind.

00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:57.639
Who could sleep like that?

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:06.119
Dad, Mom.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.599
Is she up?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.559
Not yet.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.599
I'm heading to school.

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.400
Eat something first.

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:16.639
No, I'm going now.

00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:17.760
Wait.

00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:19.360
What is it?

00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:22.559
Be careful on the way.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.800
Don't worry, Mom.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.850
- Take this to eat on the way.
- Thanks, Dad.

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:29.039
I'm off.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.039
Don't worry too much, both of you.

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:33.519
Keep your eyes on the road
when you're riding.

00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:41.400
A child is always a mother's heart.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.400
You know, Jianqi and

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.639
our daughter really loved each other.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.159
I think

00:37:57.079 --> 00:37:59.519
she won't be able to give up this baby.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.440
Sounds like you're the one
who can't let go.

00:38:03.999 --> 00:38:06.320
But didn't they say already

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.519
they'd support her
if she wanted to remarry?

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:09.880
Besides,

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:11.440
as her mother,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.479
you see,

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:14.800
Jianqi's mother lost her son.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.210
If she loses her grandson too...

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:19.639
She just wants something to hold on to.

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:21.360
Otherwise, she'd lose her mind,
you know?

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.159
I don't care
who loses their mind right now.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.999
What matters is how our daughter
is going to live her life.

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:33.159
You're awake, Mingzhu?

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.400
Didn't sleep a bit longer?

00:38:35.639 --> 00:38:36.840
Did we wake you up?

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:37.840
No.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.999
I'm going to the hospital.

00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:43.320
I didn't have time to show the doctor
the last ultrasound report.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.440
I'll go with you.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.159
No need, Mom.

00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:48.440
You have the shop to open soon.

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:50.079
I can go by myself.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.920
Let your mom go with you.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.559
Yes.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.360
Dad.

00:38:54.159 --> 00:38:57.400
There are some roads
I have to learn to walk alone.

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:18.960
Hello, Ni.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.599
What are you doing?

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:23.079
I'm heading to the hospital
for a prenatal checkup.

00:39:23.559 --> 00:39:24.639
Which hospital?

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.880
I'll come with you.

00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:26.760
No need.

00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:29.400
I didn't even let my mom come with me.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:31.440
I just want to see

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.880
if I can really do this on my own.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.840
Alright.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.639
If anything happens, call me anytime.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:38.920
Got it.

00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:39.840
Don't worry.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.400
Wasn't there a hero
who saved a drowning child?

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:43.479
Did he live here?

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.639
That young woman just now

00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:46.679
is the hero's wife.

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:48.999
She was abandoned

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.639
by her parents when she was little.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.840
When she grew up, she married

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.320
a good man, a real catch.

00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:56.079
But right after they got married,

00:39:56.199 --> 00:39:58.639
he drowned while saving that child.

00:39:58.679 --> 00:39:59.800
Such a good man.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.639
Doctor, please save him.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.280
He's a fine young man.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.199
Do everything you can.

00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:08.079
She's carrying his child.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.800
At least the baby

00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:11.320
will carry on his name.

00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:12.840
But she's still so young.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.800
Once the baby's born,

00:40:13.999 --> 00:40:15.800
how will she live from then on?

00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:23.800
Excuse us, please.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.079
Make some room.

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:09.800
Jianqi.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.960
I wish you were here with me.

00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:18.039
Do you think I can make it on my own?

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.479
You always said I was strong.

00:41:22.199 --> 00:41:22.920
Was I?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.159
