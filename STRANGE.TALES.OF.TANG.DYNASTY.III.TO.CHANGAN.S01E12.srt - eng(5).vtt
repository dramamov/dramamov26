[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.000
[Episode 12]

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.630
In my humble opinion,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.740
that's not merely about incense offerings

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.180
but about the foundation and stability
of the state.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.570
Now, rumors are spreading everywhere,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.580
and everyone is in a state of panic.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.640
If this continues,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.890
Chang'an will descend into chaos!

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.509
How dare you!

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.460
Guards!

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.570
Seize him!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.130
Attendant Yang.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.979
Your Majesty,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.590
those words he just spoke

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.770
were outrageous.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.120
It's not that serious.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.530
It was just a figure of speech.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.140
In our youth,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.520
we studied
and practiced martial arts together.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.560
Today, we're just drinking
and reminiscing.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.290
Don't make a fuss over nothing.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.260
You may leave.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.030
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.960
Lu Lingfeng,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.110
what you just said was far too much.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.750
Lu Tong.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.560
I...

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.380
would like to hear him finish.

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.050
When people's hearts are at peace,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.210
the state will stand unshaken.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.750
If Your Majesty visits Chengfo Temple
in person,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.320
the rumors about demons plaguing Chang'an

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.970
will vanish of their own accord!

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.170
You make a fair point.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.300
But you only have this one chance.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.150
You truly don't want to use it
to advance your career?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.390
I was planning

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.079
to have you return to the Imperial Guard

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.010
and restore your former position.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.700
Lu Lingfeng,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.200
quickly thank His Majesty for his grace!

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.580
I thank Your Majesty for your grace.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.590
Though my current post
as Yongzhou Judicial Official

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.590
is of modest rank,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.160
it's extremely important.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.030
Although I cannot serve
at Your Majesty's side,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.400
catching thieves and criminals

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.520
and ensuring the people of Chang'an
live in peace

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.780
also helps ease Your Majesty's burdens.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.760
Therefore...

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.090
I, Lu Lingfeng, wish to remain

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.810
in this position a bit longer!

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.310
Su Wuming taught you
on behalf of his mentor,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.170
making you Master Di's disciple?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.170
That's true.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.200
It's my great fortune.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.140
Your mentor

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.550
solved countless mysterious cases
in his lifetime.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.190
Serving as a Judicial Official

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.390
truly makes better use of your talents.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.890
Lu Tong,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.310
you see how it is, don't you?

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.960
It's not that I don't want him back—

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.890
he himself doesn't want to return.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.570
Today's banquet

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.190
is to reward my meritorious officials
who served during the Tanglong Incident,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.250
and each of you has received a reward.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.340
As for Lu Lingfeng's request,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.690
I shall grant it as well.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.440
In three days,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.930
I'll visit Chengfo Temple
to offer incense!

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.510
[Grand Princess's Mansion]

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.310
Though Chengfo Temple is large,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.870
it was originally unremarkable
among the capital's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.070
many famous temples.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.280
It was Your Highness
who invited Qin Xiaobai,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.480
and that's what made it famous.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.240
Thus,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.390
Guangxiao now is

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.500
like someone who was first lifted
to the clouds

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.180
and then dropped to the ground
with a smack—

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.870
how could he not be shattered?

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.190
Su Wuming,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.630
you truly have a silver tongue.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.690
As for

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.030
the rumors of ghosts,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.680
although the Yongzhou Prefecture Office
has posted notices,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.940
gossip still

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.870
circulates through the streets.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.110
I fear such tales of demons

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.070
will cause chaos in Chang'an.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720
Rumors are spreading among the people—

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.310
how can I silence them?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.720
Perhaps

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.960
you could personally visit Chengfo Temple

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240
to offer incense.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.610
Would that help?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.740
Of course it would.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.750
As soon as Your Highness visits,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.380
the gloom over Chengfo Temple

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.920
will clear instantly!

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.600
I need a reason to visit

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.240
Chengfo Temple.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.720
To admire the "Subjugation of Devils" again.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.800
It's that very mural

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.460
that started all the trouble.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.880
Better not to mention it.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.270
Well...

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.650
So even you get stuck sometimes, eh?

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.560
I'm foolish.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.270
At the moment, I truly cannot think of

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.270
any other excuse.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.120
Have you ever heard of

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.680
the Seven-Colored Buddhist Robe

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.409
personally woven by my mother?

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.250
I've heard something about it.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.460
Mother bestowed it upon me.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.030
I'll lend it to Chengfo Temple
for a month,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.750
so that all devotees

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.030
will have a chance to see this treasure.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.920
That truly is

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.050
a blessing for the people of Chang'an!

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.000
In three days,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.800
I'll deliver it myself.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.620
It'll be enshrined
in the Great Buddha Hall!

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.560
[Three Days Later] [Great Buddha Hall]

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.860
[Great Buddha Hall]

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.000
This humble monk did not know
Your Majesty had arrived.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.120
I failed to welcome you properly.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.980
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.680
It's fine.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.330
Your Majesty has arrived?

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.070
Aunt.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.000
At the temple gate,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.350
I saw your carriage.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.240
I hope I didn't disturb your prayers.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.510
I'm so glad you could come.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.240
This is

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.060
the Seven-Colored Buddhist Robe
woven by Empress Wu Zetian herself.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.560
Have you seen it before?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.400
I've never had such fortune.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.390
This is a treasure.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.790
Every stitch and every thread

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.240
has a story behind it.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.390
Come on,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.560
let me explain it to you in detail.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.840
This Seven-Colored Buddhist Robe

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.950
was woven from

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.500
seven different fabrics.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.830
Each piece came from

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.160
one of

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.580
the seven regions across the land,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.310
gathering the essence of heaven and earth.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.190
Lu Lingfeng, oh, Lu Lingfeng.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.590
You've got a lot of nerve.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.000
You invited His Majesty to Chengfo Temple,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.140
but why didn't you inform me in advance?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.270
His Majesty's safety is

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.720
the responsibility of the Imperial Guard.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.669
What difference would it have made
if I had informed you?

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.960
I needed to know.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.789
At the very least, I could have been
at the temple entrance

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.120
to welcome His Majesty.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.930
The point is,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.390
you weren't there either.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.140
If you had been there,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.870
you could have at least

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.200
represented our prefecture office.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.660
The notice was posted well in advance

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.390
in Dunyi District, announcing

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.790
that today's circuit trial
would be held there.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.320
How could I have been there?

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.480
Lu Lingfeng,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.010
you'll be the death of me

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.120
sooner or later!

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.440
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440
It's you, Du Ming.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.440
I only told you to summon Lu Lingfeng
to the palace.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.570
Why are you here too?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:14.750
Leave.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.960
Yes.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.550
Sit.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.630
This is the gastrodia powder
I've been taking.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.920
It can regulate the internal organs

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.920
and boost energy.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.650
You should try some too.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.550
Have a seat.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.840
Yes.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.120
Today at Chengfo Temple,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.030
I saw my aunt.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.900
You didn't arrange that deliberately,
did you?

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.540
Your Majesty, please allow me to explain.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.840
Just answer me—

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.350
did you or did you not?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.010
I did not.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.080
That's right.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.030
I personally set the date

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.490
for the incense offering.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.040
I'm very happy today.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.080
The Seven-Colored Buddhist Robe

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.030
woven by Empress Wu Zetian herself
is magnificent.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.960
I also had a very pleasant conversation
with my aunt.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.690
It reminded me of my childhood.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.630
I haven't felt

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.730
this way in so many years.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.660
You sly Su Wuming!

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.240
You said once I visited Chengfo Temple,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.750
all rumors about ghosts

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.300
would vanish on their own.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.490
Then why did you invite him there?

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.390
Your Highness has wronged me.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.680
I couldn't even get an audience

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.320
with His Majesty lately—

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.200
how could I possibly have invited him
to the temple?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.010
Could it be that he came on his own?

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.030
Was he trying to reconcile with me?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.310
Su Wuming!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.360
Why are you silent now?

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.210
What Your Highness just mentioned
is a family matter.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.370
It's not my place to comment.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.730
A family matter...

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.550
Su Wuming.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.680
I called you here to tell you...

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.750
that I'm very pleased today!

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.630
As for Mother's golden tablet

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.120
that was stolen by Li Fengjie,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.230
I'll personally send someone

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.080
to return it to the cliff

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.680
at Junjie Peak on Mount Song.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.620
It's truly exquisite.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.720
Madam Yingtao, why didn't you inform me

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.440
before coming to the temple?

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.990
Please.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.350
Please come to my quarters for some tea.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.270
No need, Buddhist Guangxiao.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.330
We're not thirsty.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.320
Then at least come sit in my quarters

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.380
so this humble monk
can express his gratitude.

[Great Buddha Hall]

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.120
Our Chengfo Temple has regained its glory

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.480
thanks to Official Lu, Scholar Su,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.390
and you two benefactors.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.750
You should give thanks to His Majesty

as well as to the peace and prosperity
of our Tang Empire.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.750
How wonderful. How wonderful.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.720
Miss Pei, your words

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.550
echo my own thoughts exactly.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.260
I'll lead all disciples

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.720
to chant sutras every night

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.720

This humble monk can see.

Are you Qin Xiaobai?

He is not.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.820
Qin Xiaobai's every feature
speaks of artistry,

From the lands by the Eastern Sea.

How long did your journey take?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.320

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.960
appear in the world!

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.880
Lu Lingfeng.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.880
Don't you understand

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.270
what Du Ming really means?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.730
What should I understand?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.610
Use your head!

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.930
I believe our current Emperor

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.640
is a virtuous ruler.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.550
But to report such a matter so rashly

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.620
is not only a crime against His Majesty

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.550
but also a deception of the people.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.800
Whatever Du Ming wants to do

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.200
is of no concern to me.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.100
But for Su Wuming to be so muddled—

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.570
how can he face his mentor?

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.600
He's probably not muddled.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.280
At most,

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.150
he's simply going with the flow.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.350
You're still too rigid.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.550
Perhaps this so-called Bai Ze appearance

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.030
is just a claim,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.000
but it's what His Majesty needs.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.880
Why so stubborn about it?

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.010
When you put it that way,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.610
I find myself...

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.680
less troubled.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.000
I admire your attitude of seeking truth

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.660
based on empirical evidence.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.240
But you're in officialdom, after all.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440
Even if Su Wuming

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.570
opposed it with you,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.810
you think Du Ming wouldn't report it?

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.070
For some matters,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.340
you should listen more to Wuming.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.440
He's also your senior,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.110
and he's always helping
and protecting you.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.400
Who is it?

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.550
Who is it?

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.920
It's so late.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.110
What brings you knocking at my door?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.060
I wanted to go to the capital

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.680
but got lost.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.420
I hope you could give me directions, sir.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.550
Even if you reached the capital now,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.720
the city gates would be closed.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.510
And it's already late.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.590
You're all alone.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.000
It's not safe.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.200
What should I do then?

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.350
How about...

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.480
Didn't you say

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.920
I could come in and rest?

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:06.940
Yes.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.310
I meant

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.400
the two of us

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.310
could rest together.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.200
You're so naughty.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.090
What does that mean?

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.350
Who was that

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.440
beautiful woman?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.450
Are you stupid?

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.590
Don't you realize

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.350
she wasn't even human?

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.240
Not human?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
I asked you to tell us something exciting!

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.480
I...

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.940
Is that the best you could come up with?

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.200
In the dead of night,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.180
are you trying to scare us?

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.570
Not at all.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.110
Look,

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.480
you've tied me up like this.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.940
How would I dare scare you?

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.680
That is my best story.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.150
Best story?

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.880
You said you could tell stories,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.440
so I spared your life.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.810
Turns out you only know ghost tales!

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.200
Don't hit him.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.160
What are you looking at?

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.270
I'll deal with you later.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.560
Don't worry.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.710
I don't mind that you're old.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.480
Brother, why don't you eat first?

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.790
I'll go upstairs and see

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.880
if there's anything valuable.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.810
What's the rush?

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:49.560
Sit down!

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.290
Let this old fool

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400
finish his story.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.440
I think it's quite interesting.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.570
Continue!

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.440
Just as that lost woman

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.680
was about to tear into the scholar,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.240
she suddenly discovered...

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.880
It's getting late.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.590
I should hurry on my way.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.950
We're already sharing a bed.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.030
Why leave?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.460
You have no shadow either.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.290
You're not human?

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.750
Of course, I'm not human.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.730
You've only just realized?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.590
It's too late.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.970
He scared the wits out of me.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.860
You old fool.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.210
How dare you try to scare us?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.590
No, no.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.420
Do you like

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.620
my story?

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.480
Kill these two

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.270
old fools!

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.640
No, Brother!

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.030
That woman may be old,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.270
but she's not ugly.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.790
It's been over half a month

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.350
since I've had a woman.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.830
No, please don't. Don't...

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.390
Why are you just standing there?

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.400
Wh-What's that sound?

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.120
Is that a lion or a tiger?

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.560
Old fool, I'm asking you!

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.040
Look at this divine statue!

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.880
This is the Bai Ze Temple.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.880
I'm Hermit Baize.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.350
My wife Zi is also protected
by the divine beast.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.880
You've angered the divine beast!

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.590
Tonight,

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.480
not even a scrap of your bones

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.790
will remain!

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.920
Old fool, I'll chop you down!

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.350
[The Tracks of Bai Ze]

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.720
Bai Ze?

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.590
Based solely on a hunter's sighting,

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.030
you conclude an auspicious beast
has appeared—

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.440
isn't that rather hasty?

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.880
Actually,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.400
this isn't the first time someone

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.510
has encountered the divine beast Bai Ze

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.200
in the depths of Mount Zhongnan.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.350
It's just that previous witnesses

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.350
never got a clear look at the divine beast

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.750
before fleeing in panic.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.640
Only this time

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.240
did someone see it clearly.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.680
It has a tiger's head,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.520
a lion's body,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.750
and deer antlers.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.510
Its tail has nine sections
and three forks.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.880
That was truly Bai Ze!

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.820
I was uncertain at first,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.400
so I consulted Su Wuming.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.110
Su Wuming?

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.400
You asked him?

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.920
Though Su Wuming holds
no official position,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.780
he is Master Di's disciple.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.570
He's known for his vast knowledge
and sharp memory.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.310
Therefore...

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.170
What did he say?

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.120
He confirmed—

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.910
that was undoubtedly Bai Ze!

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.590
After all, having received
the true teachings of Di Renjie,

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.190
he must have some knowledge.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.350
Consulting him on such matters...

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.760
was not inappropriate.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.160
If that's the case,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.510
Bai Ze has truly appeared in the world?

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.470
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.750
What is there to congratulate?

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.270
Your Majesty,

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.070
the Spring and Autumn Annals

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.680
recorded the discovery of a Qilin.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.110
Now that Bai Ze has appeared,

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.310
it's an auspicious sign for our state.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.720
Indeed, indeed.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.880
I've heard that when a sage ruler arises,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.960
Bai Ze will appear.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.440
Now that Your Majesty has just
ascended the throne,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.000
and this auspicious beast
has been discovered,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.030
it proves

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.220
Your Majesty is truly
a sovereign chosen by Heaven!

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.550
I have no such virtue or ability.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.030
It must be due to the Retired Emperor's
virtuous rule.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.810
When the Bai Ze appears,
prosperity follows.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.160
I think we should announce this
to the world.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.920
There's no rush.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.110
The appearance of the Bai Ze

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.200
is truly rare.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.750
Should I personally go to Mount Zhongnan

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.290
to catch a glimpse of it?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.200
Your Majesty must not.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.160
Mount Zhongnan is perilous
and filled with fierce beasts.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.560
I'm willing to go
on Your Majesty's behalf.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:48.590
Grand General...

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:49.050
Lu Tong,

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.240
your vision difficulties

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.170
might hinder you in the mountains.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.110
Since Du Ming reported this matter,

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.110
I'll leave it to him.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.570
The first to find Bai Ze

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.720
will be rewarded with 1,000 gold pieces,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.030
granted purple robes and a noble title,

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.070
and receive a fief of 1,000 households.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.550
Yes.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.070
We at the Yongzhou Prefecture Office
will spare no effort

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.600
in searching for the Bai Ze.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.830
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.480
His Majesty has entrusted this matter

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.720
to us.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.730
Official Lu,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.270
I'll be counting on you?

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.400
Chief Administrator Du,

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.590
are we really going into the mountains

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.030
to search for Bai Ze?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.510
Of course.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.640
His Majesty intended to go himself.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.590
Now,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.370
Official Lu,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.190
I order you

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.070
to enter the mountains
in His Majesty's stead.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.880
Since I, Lu Lingfeng,

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.680
became the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.480
I've established the Mobile Court

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.640
to handle cases around the city.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.270
So far,

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.030
of Chang'an's 110 districts,

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.830
I've held court in fewer than 20.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.750
With official duties at hand,

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.680
I cannot comply.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.270
Lu Lingfeng.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.510
Why do you think His Majesty

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.830
entrusted such an important matter

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.960
to us?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.440
And who among us

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.170
is suited for such a great task?

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.030
His Majesty couldn't have been clearer.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.960
He all but named you.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.260
If you don't go,

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.440
are you defying an imperial order?

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.200
Besides,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.310
the first to find Bai Ze

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.110
will be granted purple robes
and a noble title.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.070
What a great opportunity this is.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.590
I worked hard

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.070
to secure this chance for you.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.590
Du Ming!

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.550
I've always respected your character

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.960
for being rigorous and fair.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.530
Now

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.550
you flatter His Majesty to his face,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.350
which is bad enough,

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.350
but here you're spouting nonsense!

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.210
How dare you!

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.210
Lu Lingfeng,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.070
how dare you speak to
Chief Administrator Du like that?

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.110
You've gone too far!

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.710
Su Wuming!

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.480
This is all your doing!

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.610
Lu Lingfeng!

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.960
He's still too young

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.400
and impulsive.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.750
Well, Chief Administrator Du,
how about this?

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.350
Well,

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.200
I'm willing to go into the mountains

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.480
to find Bai Ze.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.240
I...

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.960
You?

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.440
A Criminal Investigation Scholar?

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.440
You don't even hold
a proper official post!

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.030
You searching for the auspicious beast
for His Majesty?

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.090
Has our Tang Empire run out of people?

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.840
However,

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.610
His Majesty did say

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.830
you're Master Di's direct disciple

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:19.830
with some knowledge.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.550
You may join the search for the Bai Ze,

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.270
but Lu Lingfeng must go!

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.000
I only suspected it was Bai Ze.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.070
The one who confirmed it

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.480
was you, Su Wuming.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.550
I reported that truthfully
to His Majesty as well.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.480
How is that my confirmation?

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.270
I...

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.590
Lu Lingfeng,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.960
as the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.160
will lead a team into the mountains

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.550
to search for traces of the Bai Ze.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:51.720
It's your undeniable duty!

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.650
You shall depart

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.150
early tomorrow morning!

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.920
Chief Administrator Du,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.850
can't you see he's unwilling?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.790
I don't care whether he's willing or not!

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.110
He will lead the team into the mountains.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.280
Who goes with him

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.550
is his decision.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.440
If he insists on disobeying,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.100
he'll bear the consequences!

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.410
[Pei's Mansion]

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:20.320
Xue Huan,

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.690
go call your master for dinner.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.040
It's rare for us to have a meal
at home like this.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.190
Well then,

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.790
this scholar

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.590
would like to propose a toast to you all.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.720
Come on, cheers.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.200
According to legend,

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.070
when the Yellow Emperor toured
the shore of the Eastern Sea,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.550
upon meeting the Bai Ze,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.350
the auspicious beast spoke in
human language,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.880
saying,

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.880
"Since ancient times, all beings
born of vital energy,

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.540
and all wandering spirits
that took shape...."

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.920
By that he meant demons and ghosts.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.200
There are 11,520 kinds in total.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.830
Nonsense.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:08.590
I've heard of that.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.650
The Yellow Emperor

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.000
had someone record what the Bai Ze said

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.070
and created the Bai Ze Scroll, right?

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.870
That's right.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.030
The Bai Ze Scroll recorded

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.440
the names of various demons and ghosts,

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.270
as well as

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.310
methods to subdue them.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.350
Superstitious rubbish meant to
fool the common folk!

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.080
Lu Lingfeng,

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.310
you don't mean me, do you?

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.270
Who else would I mean?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.550
I won't stoop to your level.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.700
Let me ask you this:

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.240
Chief Administrator Du has asked you
to form a team

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.310
and enter the deep mountains

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.400
to search for the Bai Ze beast.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.350
Are you going or not?

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.310
You think I'm like you?

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.310
If I engaged in such absurd activities,

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.640
the Lu family of Fanyang

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.450
would become a laughingstock!

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.240
That's a real shame then.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.030
I was thinking

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.590
we could take this opportunity

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.070
for the six of us

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.070
to journey deep into Mount Zhongnan

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.000
and have some fun for a few days.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.550
That sounds wonderful!

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.230
Yeah,

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.889
what a wonderful idea.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.230
But he won't take us.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:13.840
Su Wuming!

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.440
Let me ask you:

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.440
if you just go into the mountains for fun,

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.500
how will you report when you get back?

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.070
I'll just say

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.880
we didn't find Bai Ze.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.030
Then as a Judicial Official,

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.150
wouldn't I appear incompetent?

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.960
The duty of a Judicial Official

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.960
is to enforce the law, manage cases,

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.590
and supervise the capture of criminals.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.070
Not finding Bai Ze

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.440
only means it wasn't fated—

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.320
how could that be called incompetence?

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.710
If you know we can't find it,

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.760
why did you agree to

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.000
this absurd task?

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.760
My dear junior,

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.000
the court has been in chaos for years.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.590
Now

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.760
a new emperor has ascended the throne

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.760
and wishes to pacify the people.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.280
The auspicious beast Bai Ze appearing now

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.760
has comes at the perfect time.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.590
This is what our state needs

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.050
for peace and prosperity!

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.760
Hearing Wuming explain it that way,

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.290
I find it quite reasonable.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.630
Lu Lingfeng,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.760
I know you're an honest man.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.550
But if it's for the nation's
peace and prosperity,

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.110
leading an expedition into Mount Zhongnan

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.370
would not be unbecoming for a gentleman.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.830
Gentlemanly,

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:29.880
indeed!

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.550
What in the world are they talking about?

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.150
I understand less and less.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.960
Isn't it just going sightseeing?

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.400
Are we going or not?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.360
Xijun,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.800
you're not

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.530
siding with Su Wuming, are you?

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.800
Of course not.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.480
It's not unbecoming of a gentleman?

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.610
It's not just gentlemanly!

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.960
It's...

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.630
extremely gentlemanly!

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:58.870
Then let's go.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.500
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.140
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.490
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.770
I know

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.790
that even though you agreed,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.990
you're unwilling in your heart.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.590
The one who knows me best

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.670
is you, Xijun.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.150
I really miss my younger days,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.670
when life was genuine

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.410
and pure,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.280
untouched by pretense

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.440
or hypocrisy.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.150
I actually think

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.960
the person you are today

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.360
deserves respect.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.480
You're a man of integrity,

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.980
yet flexible in dealing with circumstances

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.910
and mindful of the bigger picture.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.710
Since returning to Chang'an,

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.760
you've been busy with official duties

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.290
and haven't had time for me.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.570
These few days in the mountains

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.810
can be your way of making it up to me.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:42.840
That's true.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280
To love our empire

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.600
is to love its people.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.860
And you, Pei Xijun,

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.750
are the one I care about most.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.600
But deep in Mount Zhongnan,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:52.800
the trails are rough

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.040
and wild beasts roam.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.880
This journey may not be so pleasant.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.150
As long as we go together...

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.820
even the roughest path becomes smooth.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.550
Weeds and thorns

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.520
are all flowers to me.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.440
[Integrity and Humility]

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.280
Well...

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.950
Miss Pei?

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.670
Well...

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.680
Miss Pei is my sworn sister,

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.210
a master painter.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.280
If we can find Bai Ze,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.590
my sworn sister can paint it.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:43.880
Then,

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.190
when His Majesty sees it,

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.510
he'll be delighted.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.440
Indeed.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.760
Master Fei,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.030
a disciple of the Medicine King,

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.480
has exceptional medical skills.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.110
Deep in Mount Zhongnan,
dangers are unpredictable.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:58.630
What if one of us gets injured?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.430
Right, right.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.530
Miracle Doctor Fei is essential.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.280
Chief Administrator Du.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:04.550
Madam Yingtao,

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.030
Captain Xue.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.030
They both have excellent martial skills.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.400
They can help Official Lu when needed.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.360
Good!

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.760
Official Lu,

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.490
it seems my trust in you

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.630
was well-placed.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960
In just one night,

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:19.920
you've gathered

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.870
such an impressive team.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.960
Now I can rest easy.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.040
I shall remain at
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office,

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.480

Life as Chief Administrator is
so comfortable.

You...

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.720
Wh-What do you mean by that?

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.250
That's inappropriate.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.550
Come on.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.320
[Integrity and Humility]

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.850
This is Ling Ji,

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:48.480
a hunter from Mount Zhongnan.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.410
He's the one who discovered Bai Ze.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.940
He knows the terrain there extremely well

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.150
[Ling Ji, Hunter]

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.800
and can serve as your guide.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.000
This way...

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.840
it's an excellent arrangement.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.190
Good, very good.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.230
Then you shall depart.
