COUNTERATTACK SIGNAL

02:24.960 --> 02:26.000
<i>What the—?</i>

02:27.960 --> 02:29.790
<i>Why was I asleep?</i>

02:30.330 --> 02:31.750
<i>Ow...ow, ow, oww!</i>

02:31.920 --> 02:34.790
<i>Wait now.</i>
<i>What happened to me?</i>

02:36.750 --> 02:39.580
<i>I lost to a monster.</i>

02:40.330 --> 02:41.880
<i>Yet, I'm still alive.</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:43.170
<i>What's going on?</i>

02:44.960 --> 02:46.250
<i>And what happened to that kid?</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:50.710
<i>That ugly brat.</i>
<i>Did they let him go?</i>

02:51.130 --> 02:52.460
<i>Or don't tell me, they...</i>

02:54.210 --> 02:55.420
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

02:55.540 --> 02:57.250
<i>I need to stop my bleeding.</i>

02:57.460 --> 02:59.630
<i>Actually...it's already stopped.</i>

03:00.170 --> 03:04.380
<i>Hm? My clothes are stuck to the wounds</i>
<i>and won't come off.</i>

03:04.500 --> 03:06.500
<i>They're completely fused together.</i>

03:07.080 --> 03:08.330
Now then...

03:29.460 --> 03:32.880
<i>The signal from</i>
<i>Dig-Here Doggie No.3 broke off.</i>

03:34.420 --> 03:36.830
<i>He found it.</i>
<i>Which means we're close.</i>

03:37.290 --> 03:39.040
<i>I should be able to</i>
<i>pinpoint their base soon.</i>

03:40.210 --> 03:43.290
Are we finally zeroing in
on their stronghold, Child Emperor?

03:43.630 --> 03:44.790
Mr. Sekingal.

03:45.540 --> 03:48.290
Tornado's been
pressuring us to hurry.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.420
Have the Class-S heroes gathered?

03:50.540 --> 03:51.670
Not all of them.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.290
Tank-Top Master and Metal Bat
are in the hospital.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.420
Drive Knight is missing.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.170
Watchdog Man and Metal Knight
have refused to participate.

04:00.290 --> 04:02.710
Not having everyone on board
this time really hurts.

04:02.830 --> 04:05.080
Zombieman is on his way here.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.710
We still haven't been able to
get in touch with...

04:08.000 --> 04:11.290
Silverfang, Demon Cyborg, and King.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.250
We plan to add all three
to the team.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.959
Class-S heroes are going to
be crucial to this operation.

04:19.790 --> 04:20.829
Wait a second.

04:21.079 --> 04:25.920
Actually, I did a bit of research
on Genos the Demon Cyborg.

04:26.330 --> 04:28.920
He lives in City Z's
ghost town, right?

04:29.250 --> 04:32.290
The Monster Association's hideout is
somewhere in the ghost town, right?

04:33.080 --> 04:36.330
Even the town he was born in
has disappeared from the map.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.330
Doesn't that sound suspicious?

04:38.540 --> 04:42.080
There are lots of heroes with
unknown origins or secrets.

04:42.170 --> 04:43.330
Why mention this now?

04:43.710 --> 04:46.830
We still know very little about
the enemy organization.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.880
The number and strength
of the monsters remain unknown.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.080
If there's a traitor among us

04:52.170 --> 04:55.380
our plans and infiltration routes
could be compromised.

04:55.580 --> 04:57.500
We might all be wiped out
if things go wrong.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.920
Genos is a newcomer and hasn't
proven himself to gain our full trust.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.830
<i>Don't trust anyone around you.</i>

05:05.380 --> 05:07.920
Are you worried he might betray us?

05:08.630 --> 05:10.920
If you have any doubts
just ask him directly.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.880
No, we shouldn't
share any information with him

05:14.000 --> 05:16.790
and he should be
entirely excluded from this operation.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.790
We can't afford
any more risk factors.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.670
But from a strategic standpoint...

05:23.460 --> 05:25.920
No, you're right.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.420
This is a rescue and sweep mission
we cannot afford to fail.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.290
Demon Cyborg is off the team.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.130
One more thing...

05:35.210 --> 05:38.630
I think it's odd that
Silverfang let Garou slip away.

05:39.170 --> 05:42.460
He must have held back because of
his attachment to his former disciple.

05:43.960 --> 05:48.130
It's been confirmed that Garou is allied
with the Monster Association.

05:48.330 --> 05:50.920
Unfortunately, we need to
remove Silverfang as well.

05:51.540 --> 05:52.830
Understood.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.920
But you need King, right?

05:57.170 --> 05:58.210
Of course.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.330
King is one of our key fighters.

06:00.830 --> 06:05.000
The hideout should be located soon.
Let everyone know.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.500
You're removing Silverfang and
Demon Cyborg from the operation?

06:09.670 --> 06:14.710
Yes. But instead, I'll gather
capable heroes from Class A to C

06:14.830 --> 06:16.630
and have them support Class S.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.080
They may lack in combat ability,
but it's better than nothing.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.130
If they can support Class S even slightly
that’s good enough.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.170
Don't treat them like
they're disposable!

06:25.330 --> 06:27.250
They could die!

06:27.420 --> 06:30.920
I don't expect everyone who goes in
to make it out alive.

06:31.080 --> 06:35.380
But that's a risk they accepted
when they chose the path of a pro hero.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.500
The life of a hostage is at stake.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.380
Some sacrifices are inevitable.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.380
Sekingal...Have you thought
about the consequences?

06:44.460 --> 06:48.630
If we lose more heroes to injury or death
we will be short-handed...

06:48.750 --> 06:50.210
Sitch, I remember that you were

06:50.290 --> 06:53.040
in charge of the Earthdoom Prophecy
Emergency Response Team.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.500
So I understand
where you're coming from.

06:56.040 --> 07:01.130
You want us to be prepared for a possible
worst-case scenario, right?

07:01.670 --> 07:04.250
But I have
a different take on this.

07:04.710 --> 07:06.420
The Monster Association itself is

07:06.540 --> 07:08.790
what the "Earthdoom" prophecy
was warning us about.

07:09.540 --> 07:13.080
If left unchecked, they will
eventually destroy humanity.

07:13.540 --> 07:17.420
If that's the case, this is a
critical moment for the Hero Association.

07:17.830 --> 07:23.540
If we overcome this, we'll no longer live
in fear of that cursed prophecy.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.130
The future doesn't matter.

07:26.460 --> 07:30.290
In any case, I am the team leader
of the hostage rescue mission.

07:31.420 --> 07:35.960
Don't contact Silverfang and the others
behind my back. Got that?

07:38.170 --> 07:45.170
BUBBLE BUBBLE

07:47.080 --> 07:54.080
SIMMERING

08:07.210 --> 08:08.250
It's ready.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.250
SWISH

08:10.500 --> 08:14.540
SWISH SWISH SWISH

08:24.420 --> 08:25.460
FWIP

08:28.420 --> 08:29.460
SNATCH

08:30.460 --> 08:33.789
Why are you taking Master's meat,
Hellish Blizzard?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.750
Demon Cyborg Genos...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.830
Are you satisfied
being his sidekick?

08:39.039 --> 08:42.630
Stop it. Hot pots are meant to
be shared and enjoyed together.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.380
Hey, don't take all the tofu!

08:45.830 --> 08:46.880
Hang on a sec.

08:47.580 --> 08:50.710
You know, there's
something that's bugging me.

08:51.790 --> 08:55.380
Why are you guys acting like it’s totally
fine to eat someone else's hot pot?

08:56.250 --> 08:59.130
The napa cabbage is all gone.
Go home already.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.250
That's right.
Go home.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.380
It's cramped in here.

09:02.460 --> 09:03.460
That includes you.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.580
Silverfang I can understand.

09:05.710 --> 09:09.460
But a random old man has no business
hanging out with this group.

09:10.420 --> 09:13.500
If you want to join
the Blizzard Bunch

09:13.580 --> 09:16.170
you need to show me
you're worth it.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.290
SIZZLE

09:17.380 --> 09:19.250
Huh? The Blizzard Bunch?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.830
You want me to annihilate you?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.210
Wait, Genos!
Don't break anything!

09:24.540 --> 09:26.250
Calm down, Genos.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.420
- This isn't like you.
- Right.

09:28.580 --> 09:32.960
I feel as though I've gotten to see
a new side of you.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.750
That makes me happy.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
You can forget about fighting,
share a hot pot, and speak openly here.

09:39.130 --> 09:41.330
You're lucky to have
good friends, Genos.

09:41.460 --> 09:42.500
Doctor...

09:43.290 --> 09:44.880
This woman is not my friend.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.580
"This woman"?
How rude.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.130
R-Really?

09:48.250 --> 09:50.630
But you're both heroes from
the same organization, right?

09:50.830 --> 09:53.040
Yes, but that's totally irrelevant.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.210
I see.

09:54.330 --> 09:58.500
<i>Wow... He's never disagreed with me</i>
<i>so adamantly.</i>

09:58.630 --> 10:00.750
<i>I just saw another side of him.</i>

10:00.880 --> 10:03.080
You said your name
is Kuseno, right?

10:03.670 --> 10:08.080
You’ve got impressive skills
crafting weapons for Demon Cyborg.

10:08.380 --> 10:12.210
We could hire you to develop weapons
for the Blizzard Bunch.

10:12.330 --> 10:17.380
Hey... If you insult Dr. Kuseno
any more, I'll incinerate you.

10:17.580 --> 10:20.080
Now, now. It's quite all right.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.630
Saitama.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.130
I wanted to ask you about
your thoughts on how to train disciples.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.580
Huh? My thoughts?
I don't really have any in particular.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.500
Where did I go wrong?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.580
Our dojo valued strength
more than anything else.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.580
Maybe that was wrong?

10:37.830 --> 10:38.960
Depends on the person.

10:39.210 --> 10:44.880
Hey Bang, don't start a long story
while Master Saitama is eating.

10:45.830 --> 10:47.000
Hey, Bang's brother.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.710
Stop hoarding the napa cabbage
and give some to Master.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.920
Hey, Kuseno.
Can you pass me the tea?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.920
Hey, don't tell the doctor
what to do.

11:02.130 --> 11:05.960
Kuseno, old man. Could you bring
some good meat next time, too?

11:06.080 --> 11:08.130
Stop making rude requests...

11:08.290 --> 11:10.170
I'm so sorry, Master!

11:11.210 --> 11:12.960
You should rest, Genos.

11:19.670 --> 11:22.500
Hard to relax with
so many people here.

11:22.670 --> 11:24.790
Once you're done eating
just go home, seriously.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.290
You too, King.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.630
Huh? How come you're lying down?

11:29.170 --> 11:30.790
Hey, don't fall asleep here!

11:31.040 --> 11:33.170
Hey, hey!

11:35.630 --> 11:36.670
He's dead.

12:06.130 --> 12:09.380
<i>An intruder...</i>
<i>In passage A-8...</i>

12:09.920 --> 12:11.630
<i>It's not a machine.</i>
<i>It's a living being.</i>

12:12.000 --> 12:13.960
<i>A monster who wants to join us?</i>

12:14.290 --> 12:16.630
<i>Or perhaps a scout from</i>
<i>the Hero Association?</i>

12:17.170 --> 12:19.460
<i>No, but to come here all alone...</i>

12:19.880 --> 12:22.130
<i>That's far too reckless.</i>

12:22.670 --> 12:26.750
<i>The final battle is approaching,</i>
<i>so I must verify this carefully.</i>

12:27.130 --> 12:28.130
Listen up.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.250
Looks like something's here again.
Go greet it.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.710
If it's a monster, bring it here.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.960
If it's anything else,
do whatever you want with them.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.420
Hey, wake up already!
It's morning.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.380
Hey!

12:48.750 --> 12:51.460
Hm? What am I doing here?

12:51.580 --> 12:53.670
You passed out fighting over meat.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.290
I thought you were a goner.

12:57.330 --> 12:58.630
Where are the others?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.830
I kicked them out after dinner.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.380
Genos is getting repairs.

13:02.670 --> 13:05.460
I-I see. I'm the only one
who stayed over?

13:05.540 --> 13:07.670
Sorry, Saitama.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.290
Don't worry about it.

13:09.710 --> 13:12.080
On your way out,
take the trash to the dump.

13:12.630 --> 13:15.500
It's in the residential area,
so it's kinda far from here.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.580
They're collecting
plastic bottles today.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.880
Wow, I slept really well.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.790
<i>What a peaceful</i>
<i>and refreshing morning</i>

13:25.880 --> 13:28.130
<i>with no noise from people or cars.</i>

13:29.040 --> 13:30.420
<i>A ghost town...</i>

13:30.830 --> 13:35.000
<i>They say the high monster</i>
<i>appearance rate drove people away</i>

13:35.330 --> 13:37.630
<i>but surprisingly,</i>
<i>I haven't run into any at all.</i>

13:38.380 --> 13:43.290
<i>Maybe Saitama living here actually</i>
<i>drove the monsters away.</i>

13:44.250 --> 13:46.830
<i>They say if you keep a cat in</i>
<i>a house infested with rats</i>

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
<i>the rats will disappear.</i>

13:49.420 --> 13:53.250
<i>But...sometimes the rats are</i>
<i>just hiding in the attic.</i>

13:53.540 --> 13:57.380
<i>Maybe monsters are gathering</i>
<i>underground in nests instead...</i>

13:58.580 --> 14:01.830
<i>Yuck... Just thinking about it</i>
<i>gives me the creeps.</i>

14:05.210 --> 14:06.830
Hm? Hey, did you just...

14:07.880 --> 14:09.750
...come from
the other side of the fence?

14:09.830 --> 14:11.540
No, you must be imagining things!

14:13.710 --> 14:15.250
There, all done.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.380
<i>It's amazing that people still go to work</i>
<i>even in times like this.</i>

14:25.960 --> 14:28.630
Hm?
Someone's in front of my house.

14:29.290 --> 14:31.170
Oh! He's home!

14:31.920 --> 14:35.250
Thank god.
We've been waiting for you, King!

14:35.670 --> 14:38.580
We couldn't get in touch with you,
so we searched everywhere!

14:38.750 --> 14:40.330
<i>Oh, they're from the Association.</i>

14:40.500 --> 14:45.580
Oh, sorry.
My transmitter was broken during a fight.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.290
Where were you last night?

14:47.460 --> 14:49.250
Umm, City Z.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.580
Those stains on your clothes!

14:51.750 --> 14:53.880
Bodily fluids and flesh
from monsters?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.040
- This is from the hot pot...
- You must've been in

14:56.130 --> 14:58.630
- Did I have any?
- an intense battle all night long.

15:00.130 --> 15:04.420
King, you must be exhausted
having fought without sleep or rest

15:04.540 --> 15:07.380
but we need you to accompany us
to the Headquarters at once!

15:14.790 --> 15:19.080
Captain Tongara said
he'd contact me every two hours

15:19.210 --> 15:22.500
but I haven't heard anything
from the unit all night.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.040
I assembled the best possible team

15:25.130 --> 15:27.130
and equipped them with
the finest weapons.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.830
Did the operation fail?

15:29.130 --> 15:30.330
Were they wiped out?

15:30.710 --> 15:33.210
Could they really be
defeated so easily?

15:33.580 --> 15:37.500
Even if the heroes head there,
won't they meet the same fate?

15:38.790 --> 15:39.830
Mr. Narinki.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.830
Looks like
you haven't slept all night.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.580
Why don't you go lie down
in the break room?

15:46.130 --> 15:50.790
Sekingal, my elite unit may
have been wiped out.

15:51.290 --> 15:52.380
This is terrifying.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.080
I have a bad feeling about this.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.960
At this rate,
we'll be crushed completely.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.330
Don't worry.

15:58.790 --> 16:02.500
I've told you before that
we will rescue your son.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.250
Please trust the Hero Association.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.630
Do we really have
a chance of winning?

16:08.130 --> 16:11.460
Metal Bat was defeated
even though he is a Class-S hero.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.790
I have no reason to trust you.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.670
You're not just putting on
a brave front, are you?

16:17.420 --> 16:19.420
Please...my son...

16:19.500 --> 16:22.290
You're his only hope.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.290
I'll give you as much
money as you want.

16:25.540 --> 16:29.170
Please! I just want to
see Waganma alive and well.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.960
For my son...!

16:31.170 --> 16:34.670
I'll give everything I own
to the Hero Association!!

16:34.830 --> 16:35.920
That won't be necessary.

16:36.540 --> 16:37.630
Who said that?

16:37.960 --> 16:41.540
Only those weaker than money
are swayed by it.

16:41.790 --> 16:46.080
People like that are useless
in a battle against monsters.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.290
Exactly!

16:47.790 --> 16:51.630
What's needed on the battlefield
is true courage to face evil.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.500
Isn't that what you're
trying to say, Flashy Flash?

16:54.710 --> 16:57.920
You're wrong.
Mindset is secondary.

16:58.170 --> 16:59.960
All that matters is strength.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.920
So just leave everything to me.

17:02.210 --> 17:06.630
Protecting the child is the top priority.
That's why we must act as a team.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.210
If it were just a matter of
taking them down like usual

17:09.290 --> 17:11.380
I'd have charged in with
my disciples long ago.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.170
Storming the monster hideout
with this team...

17:14.460 --> 17:16.040
Simple and straightforward.
I like it.

17:16.540 --> 17:19.750
I've been wanting to smash
an organization like this.

17:19.880 --> 17:24.420
I'll give everything I've got to bring
back that boy and my beloved inmates!

17:24.880 --> 17:27.079
I swear it on
this hand-knit sweater!

17:27.790 --> 17:29.580
I've located their hideout.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.960
All we need is King
and the backup team.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.210
We go in at noon.

17:34.830 --> 17:37.750
We'll rescue the boy and
defeat the Monster Association.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.500
Don't worry about a thing
and get some sleep.

17:40.630 --> 17:43.290
By the time you wake up,
it'll all be over, old man.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.170
Hey now! Mr. Narinki is the
Hero Association's top advisor, you know!

17:47.540 --> 17:50.920
The Class-S heroes are going to have
a brief strategy meeting, right?

17:51.170 --> 17:52.290
Let's get going.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.580
I think I'll go lie down a bit...

17:54.790 --> 17:56.960
I'm leaving it all to you,
Sekingal.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.250
Yes, you can count on me!

17:59.500 --> 18:02.130
I'll give each of you
a map of the ghost town.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.880
I've confirmed
multiple entry points

18:04.960 --> 18:07.500
so we'll split up
and enter simultaneously.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.830
I'll explain route assignments now.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.880
We finally gathered everyone,
but we're gonna split up to fight?

18:13.080 --> 18:15.380
The monsters are doing the same.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.630
Staying in one group
risks total wipeout.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.830
I'll give each of you a transmitter
to track our positions.

18:23.290 --> 18:25.250
We need to prioritize
the hostage's safety

18:25.330 --> 18:26.920
so we need a
short, decisive battle.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.960
As long as even one of us
reaches the hostage, that's enough.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.960
The backup members will
wait aboveground.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.380
If any monsters try to escape
from underground

18:35.460 --> 18:36.880
they'll be there
to finish them off.

18:37.130 --> 18:40.080
Oh, like the Whack-A-Mole game.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.380
We can't have
a bunch of monsters

18:42.460 --> 18:44.330
spilling into
the residential areas again.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.250
About the backup members...

18:46.670 --> 18:49.380
We've been recruiting every
reasonably capable fighter available.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.380
They should be able to
handle monsters

18:51.460 --> 18:53.210
up to threat-level Tiger
without issue.

18:53.330 --> 18:55.380
Don't tell me you called Blizzard.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.710
Hm? Oh yeah,
I did reach out to her.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.170
Hellish Blizzard
is a valuable asset.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.250
She's already on her way here.

19:03.380 --> 19:08.040
Absolutely not. Don't put
my little sister in danger.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.380
If you drag her into this battle
I won't forgive you.

19:11.670 --> 19:14.250
With me here,
that's more than enough. Got it?

19:14.380 --> 19:16.330
- But...
- What is your answer?

19:16.630 --> 19:18.920
Uh, understood.

19:19.170 --> 19:21.920
I'll call her
and tell her to stand down.

19:28.290 --> 19:29.380
Good morning.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.130
Have you been behaving?
I've come to get you.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.920
Just Tareo can step outside.
Let's go.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.580
What?! Why is he the only one
getting released? Not fair!

19:39.710 --> 19:42.130
Released? No, no.

19:42.250 --> 19:46.380
He's coming to my room.
So we can play.

19:47.130 --> 19:48.960
Well, you heard him.
You'd better go.

19:49.130 --> 19:52.580
N-No way!
I don't wanna! Help!

19:52.750 --> 19:56.250
Heroes! Hurry up
and save me, heroes!

19:56.380 --> 20:00.040
Um, I hate to tell you, but...

20:00.330 --> 20:04.330
The Hero Association is only trying
to rescue that kid over there.

20:04.790 --> 20:06.830
No one even knows you're here.

20:07.250 --> 20:10.210
No hero is ever coming to save you.

20:14.540 --> 20:19.790
Apparently, the monsters who went to
check on the intruder never came back.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.420
If they were killed then that means
the heroes have arrived?

20:23.880 --> 20:26.210
But we haven't heard any signal
to start the fight yet.

20:26.330 --> 20:29.000
According to Gyoro-Gyoro,
there's only one intruder.

20:29.130 --> 20:31.580
They're probably not affiliated
with the Hero Association.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.000
Look at this mess.

20:35.130 --> 20:38.330
Maybe that thing isn't even human,
after all.

20:38.790 --> 20:41.080
So that means the intruder
is a monster?

20:41.710 --> 20:46.040
Yeah, it could've been a
hot-tempered monster like King the Ripper.

20:46.250 --> 20:50.750
There are plenty of monsters out there
who hate the Monster Association.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.210
It'll be a pain
if things got chaotic

20:53.330 --> 20:55.540
before the showdown with
the Class-S heroes.

20:55.710 --> 20:59.790
Either way, just like Gyoro-Gyoro said
we need to deal with them pronto.

21:00.330 --> 21:03.130
By the way, where is King the Ripper?

21:03.290 --> 21:06.790
This is the perfect time for
a bloodthirsty psycho.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.330
Well, if he's not here

21:08.420 --> 21:10.500
then he's with the kid
he snatched yesterday.

21:10.630 --> 21:13.500
He probably can't hold
himself back anymore.

21:15.330 --> 21:18.580
Stop!

21:18.710 --> 21:21.540
Someone... Help me!

21:24.500 --> 21:26.710
Such a cute reaction.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.830
Why? Why are you doing this?

21:29.960 --> 21:33.040
Why? Because I'm a monster.

21:33.380 --> 21:37.630
Honestly, I couldn't care less
about this big war of theirs.

21:37.880 --> 21:42.040
I don't really need a new world
ruled by monsters.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.420
As long as I can unleash
my urge to shred flesh

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
that's all I need.

21:45.580 --> 21:46.750
Stop...

21:46.960 --> 21:49.330
Killing is my only reason
for living.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.290
And right now,
I'm obsessed with you.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.710
H-Help!

21:52.790 --> 21:54.580
First, your tongue.

21:54.710 --> 21:58.040
Help...me!!

22:01.040 --> 22:02.080
It's...

22:05.250 --> 22:06.290
You!!

22:19.750 --> 22:21.080
Old dude!

22:21.960 --> 22:24.080
Come on, let's go, you little brat.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.830
MONSTER KING
