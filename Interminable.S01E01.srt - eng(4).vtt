[2456 B.E.]

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.160
Who are you?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.920
Do you know Khun Phra Nai?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.360
Khun Yai would never do that.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.120
Khun Yai!

[2490 B.E.]

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.600
[2490 B.E.]
This kind of dream again.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.640
Why?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.280
- Don’t do that! / - Mum!

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.079
I promise I’ll pay you back.

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.320
Mum! Mum!

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.720
Kaew! Kaew!

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.840
Let her go!

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720
What are they doing here, Mum?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.480
We haven’t paid them rent for a while, Kaew.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.920
Go pack your things and move out of this house.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.320
Where would we stay then?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.240
Can you please give me more time?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.880
Geez! So annoying! Get out now. Out!

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.480
I said…

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.040
- Mum! / - Get out!

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.960
You barbarian! Uncultured!

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.640
Watch your mouth, brat.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.200
Get off me!

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.560
Who the fuck are you? Don’t fucking butt in.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.800
And who the fuck are you to try to hurt Khun Kaewta?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.159
They owe me rents. I’m the landlord, so I have the right to chase them out.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.520
But that doesn’t mean you have the right to hurt anyone.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.360
Here…it’s for the rents they owe you. I’ll give you the rest later.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.520
That’s better. Don’t forget to pay me the rest.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.320
But they can’t stay here anyway. The new tenant is moving in today.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.240
Let’s go.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.800
Are you all right, Khun Kaew?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.120
Er…do I know you?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360
Your water.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.880
Thank you.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.400
I’m Saen, Chao Meun Samur Jairatch’s servant.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.920
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.640
Why does it sound so familiar?

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.880
You can also call him Khun Phra Nai.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.160
So, why are you here?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.480
Please take it.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.400
Last Will and Testament?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.800
It’s Chao Meun Samur Jairatch’s last will.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.480
Why are you giving it to me?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.280
His Lordship had stated in his will to pass on the White House to his living descendants.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.880
Khun Kaewta is the only descendant who’s still alive.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.360
A descendant?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.640
How could I be related to someone of a noble rank like that?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.480
Khun Boonmee, your deceased father, was Khun Phra Nai’s distant relative.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.800
My father? Is that true, Mum?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.560
Hmm…Is it Boonmee Wongpradit?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.760
Yes, that’s right.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.920
Oh!

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.000
Oh, but…he never told me anything about it.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.840
Let’s say, Khun Kaew is now the new owner of the White House and also my new master as well.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.920
Dad!

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.920
You ras…

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.000
Hello, I’m Sin.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.480
Yes.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.680
Oh dear, that’s another one.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.640
I've told you many times not to call me Dad in front of other people.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.720
I’m sorry.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.120
Dad, do you think he’ll believe us?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.960
Don’t act suspicious then.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.200
I know that.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.480
Wait, Dad. I’m curious about one thing.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.520
What now?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.880
Why didn’t we come to see him earlier…

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.600
when we’ve already known for quite some time that he lives here?

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.559
Everything happens in its own time. And now is that time.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.920
What do you think, dear?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.720
Those two look like they’re nice people, Mum.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160
Judging from how he had helped us earlier, he seems like a good guy.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.840
Kaew!

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.400
Ruedee.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.480
Ruedee.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:43.960
Hello, Mother Chan. I brought you desserts from Ayutthaya. Going there always reminds me of you.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.840
Do you know her?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.160
Thank you, Ruedee.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.320
You’re welcome.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.920
Hey, who are those two?

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.800
You’re a descendant of Khun Phra…Phra what?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.000
Khun Phra Nai or Chao Meun Samur Jairatch.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.800
So…are you going to move into that White House right away?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.360
Please come in, Khun Kaew.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.840
Let’s go.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.400
You finally came back to me.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.160
My dear Kaewta.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.800
Let’s go inside.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.360
Let’s go

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.240
Ruedee.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.440
This house looks exactly like the one I saw in my dream.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.480
Really? Then perhaps, you’re indeed the descendant of this family.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.200
This house belonged to Chao Meun Samur Jairatch

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.640
during the reign of The Great Scholar King*(*H.M. King Vajirvudh).

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.080
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch or Khun Phra Nai was an adopted son of Chao Phraya Narubodin.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.800
Khun Phra Nai had this house built in hopes of sharing it with his lover.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.160
But not long after they had moved in, this place became deserted.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:54.960
Despite loving each other that much, they had to be parted without even saying goodbye.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.120
How tragic indeed.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.600
Kaew, you also know something about this place?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.520
I don’t know, Ruedee. I just felt that all of a sudden.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.400
Don’t scare me.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.720
Welcome home, my dear Kaewta.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.160
You still look as beautiful as ever. You haven’t changed at all.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.480
Are you also here to bid farewell?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.240
Yes, my lord.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.000
♫ Chui Chai, ♫

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.720
♫ so beautiful, ♫

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:32.240
♫ dancing with flowing grace... ♫

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.120
Be careful. It wouldn’t look good if you fall into the water.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.400
Lady Chuichai.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.600
There’s also a music room at the front of this house, the one you saw earlier.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.680
Khun Phra Nai had it built for you…

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.600
I mean, for his lover to practise dancing.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.000
Dancing?

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.640
Yes.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.800
Khun Phra Nai’s lover was a dancer from the Bureau of Classical Thai Orchestra…

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.680
who had a special talent in the Chuichai dance. It was very captivating.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.120
So much that Khun Yai didn’t want his lover to dance in front of anyone but him.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.880
Is that so?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.760
He was quite possessive.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.680
Yes.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.000
They probably loved each other so much.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.320
My friend is also good at dancing, Saen.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.720
He can dance so gracefully despite taking any lesson. Isn’t that right, Kaew?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.360
Ruedee, you’re exaggerating.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.480
But I believe you, Miss.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.000
Khun Kaew is here.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.480
Nanny Yam is a dedicated staff who has long served the family in this house.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.360
You still look the same, Khun Kaew.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.760
The same?

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.080
Have we met before?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.480
Please don’t take it seriously. She’s very old now, so she’s quite forgetful.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.960
I’m so glad you’re here. This house has been waiting for its owner to return for so long.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.760
Please don’t think of me as an owner here.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.920
I’m also a tenant like all of you.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.640
You’re not a tenant. You’re the owner of this house.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.320
And also our master.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.680
That’s right.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.600
Please don’t say that.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:30.400
From now on, there are no master or servant in this house.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.560
Let’s live here together as a family. Right, Mum?

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.760
Yes, dear.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.600
You’re still as kind and gentle as before. You haven’t changed at all.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960
This place really looks exactly like what I saw in my dream.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.080
It wasn’t just a dream.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.880
We used to have a wonderful time here in the past.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.120
This place…Is it here?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.280
Yes.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.480
It feels so familiar.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.520
You used to practise dancing here day and night.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.960
Kaew.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.520
Kaew.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.120
Mum.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.600
What are you doing here?

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:11.920
I was walking around and saw this place, so I just wanted to take a look.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.160
How come you couldn’t hear me when I kept calling for you?

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.800
Maybe because I was thinking about something.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.400
You seem to like this place a lot, don’t you?

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.840
What about you? Do you like it too?

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:36.200
Of course. I’ve never thought I’d be able to live in a house this big.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.600
Sometimes, I wonder if this were just a dream.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.920
But why do I feel so familiar with this place, Mum?

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.920
As if this White House was where I had long left it deserted.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.440
Don’t overthink about it, dear.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.800
Sometimes, our feelings can trick us into imagining things.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.880
You’re right.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.640
Come, let’s go back to that house and get some sleep.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.280
We should wake up early tomorrow to give alms to the monks.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:31.160
Good idea. I also want to make merit for Khun Phra Nai, the owner of this White House.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.680
- That’s good. Let’s go. / - Yes.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.200
Thank you, my dear, for still thinking of me.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.160
Dad, I’m curious about something.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.840
Why would you hit me?

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.760
I told you many times not to call me “Dad”.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.200
If Khun Kaew and his mother overhear it, they might feel suspicious.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.600
They’re not around.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.520
If you don’t want him to call you “Dad”, then what should he call you?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.200
Right? You’re my dad, what do you expect me to call you then?

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.480
Should I call you “man”?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.600
Can’t get me.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.800
Just call me Saen.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.000
Fine.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.360
Anyway, what were you going to ask, Sin?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.840
I just wonder why Khun Kaew can see Nanny Yam but not Khun Yai.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.080
It’s probably because of their promise.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760
Promise?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.440
The promise that has confined his spirit…

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.040
and made him unable to receive the merits offered by anyone.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.000
That’s why Khun Yai is stuck here and won’t be able to leave this place.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.600
Not until…

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.160
Until…Until what, Dad?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.480
Geez, rascal!

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.760
What now?

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.960
Why are you such a blockhead?

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.720
I’m already used to it.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.000
Fine.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.480
Until what, Saen?

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.080
[Instrumental music]

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.120
It’s your favourite song.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.720
Do you still remember, dear?

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.840
Who are you? How did you know I like this song?

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.280
Wait, you still haven’t told me who you are.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.080
Hey!

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.680
You!

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.120
Hey!

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.640
Just a dream?

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.120
Hey, you’ll make me trip.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.320
Luangta, I’m scared.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.600
What are you scared of?

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.960
A ghost.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.040
People say there’s a ghost in this place.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.800
Ghosts never frighten good people.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.600
I’ve never seen one before. Are you a good kid?

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.240
Yes.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.720
Then don’t be scared.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.640
Okay.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.760
Greetings, Luangta. / - Bless you.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.120
Just think of the person you want to dedicate this merit to.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.240
Come, dear.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:49.920
(The Buddhist chant to give a blessing to merit makers)

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.360
You finally came back.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.560
Yes?

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.920
I’m afraid you have mistaken us. We just moved in yesterday.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.680
Try to make merits whenever you can.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:23.440
When the time is right, you’ll be able to see that person you want to see.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.680
What do you mean, Luangta?

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:39.040
You’ll understand it by then. Bless you.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.000
Amen.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.840
Well, the abbot is very old. I think he’s probably quite forgetful now.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.920
Come, let’s get our things and go inside.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.400
Let me help you.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.000
Oh, thank you.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.880
Who are you?

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.639
You still remember me.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.280
Khun Kaew, you have a guest.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.400
Kaew.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.840
Ruedee.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.360
Thank you, Sin.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.800
My pleasure. I’ll go bring you some refreshments then.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.520
Thank you.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.440
Wow, this place is really nice.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.800
Kaew, you’re so lucky to own a beautiful house like this.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.360
Ruedee.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.880
Why didn’t you tell me you’d come?

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.640
So that I could pick you up. It must be tough coming here by yourself.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.040
It’s something urgent. I’m finding an excuse to avoid someone.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.680
Who?

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.680
Sophee, is that you?

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.400
Sophee.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.360
Good morning, Uncle and Auntie.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.800
Sophee is coming back from abroad today.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.680
She’ll come to my place to visit my parents. I don’t want to see her.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.960
That’s why I came to see you here instead.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.520
Sophee, your older cousin?

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.200
Yes.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.920
I don’t know why but I’ve always been scared of her since very little.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.640
Scared? Did she bully you? Why are you scared of her?

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.040
Not at all. But just one look from her…

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.680
Ugh! It makes me feel so creepy.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:37.080
Hmm, does this Sophee cousin of yours look so scary?

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.840
Not at all. She’s actually very pretty.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.600
Huh? That’s strange.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.400
I don’t understand it either.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.480
Wow.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.880
Kaew.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.520
Hmm?

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.600
You can draw a portrait now?

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.480
Yeah, I also can’t believe it myself.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.760
All this time, I’ve been trying to do it…

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.960
but I still couldn’t draw anyone.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.880
Can you only draw a portrait of me, my dear?

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.320
Yes.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.440
Promise?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.520
I promise.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.040
Kaew.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.240
Kaew!

Huh? Oh…

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.280
I’ve been calling for so many times. Can’t you hear me?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.560
What is it, Ruedee?

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:06.160
I want to ask who this handsome man is.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.880
I don’t know too.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.200
Huh? Then how can you draw him?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.600
From my memory.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.920
Does this mean you can submit your work to Ajarn Kitti?

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.920
Yes, I think so.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.280

You are truly beautiful, my cousin.

You’re such a sweet talker, Nid.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.000
So much alike.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.040
The older she gets, the more she looks like her.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Is there something wrong, Auntie?

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:09.240
Oh, nothing. You remind me of my older cousin. Her name is also Sophee.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.480
I see. My mother once told me about her too.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:21.480
Yes, your mother loves her so much that she also named you Sophee.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.920
Is she still here? I thought she already left.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.080

Kaew?

My mother wants to invite you to my brother's welcome back party.

I also have something for you.

It's an inheritance from Sophee, my cousin.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.320
I think there's a ghost trapped in that pin.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.040
What kind of ghost could be trapped in there? It's so tiny.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.960
So you also reincarnated, Kaewta!

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.680
It's really you, Sophee.
