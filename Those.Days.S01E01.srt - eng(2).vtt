=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

=Episode 1=

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.410
(Ni's Clinic)
It'll hurt a little.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.750
Next, please.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.030
My turn.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.390
One at a time.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.800
Don't rush.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.590
If you rush me, I'll smack you.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.230
You're not sick.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.100
Mingzhu, you're back.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.750
Yeah.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.560
Get your dirty hand off.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.280
If you grab again, I'll tell your dad
to break your fingers.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.820
Why are the girls in your neighborhood

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.700
so fierce?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.540
Not all.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.500
I'm not.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.660
Xiaoni,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.660
can you take my pulse?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.260
It's pregnancy pulse.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.540
She's amazing.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.820
Her dad and grandpa are
Chinese physicians.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.840
It's a family tradition.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.820
Dr. Xiaoni,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.340
you're incredible.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.020
Is the baby yours?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.980
Yes, mine.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.020
Mingzhu, you're here.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.060
Mr. Ni.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.340
There's a funeral in Yujia Village.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.840
They want me to help
with the arrangements.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.420
Dad, who died?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.860
Xiaoni,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.340
how many times have I told you?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.220
Don't say "died".

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.860
Just say they "went to enjoy blessings".

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.780
Mr. Ni,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.580
your family provides the full package

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.500
from treating illnesses
to sending people off.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.260
Xiaoni has inherited your skills.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.460
She's a genius.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.460
I'm flattered.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.340
But she's gifted.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.580
Have you eaten?

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.940
Come eat at my place.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.660
No thanks.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.510
We're heading back to my house
to have dinner.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.420
Shen's a good cook.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.660
You're a lucky guy.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.500
Yeah.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.940
Xiaoni,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.900
I'm going. Bye-bye.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.100
You can't get pregnant before marriage.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.940
(Marriage Certificate)
Look at this.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.500
Marriage certificates

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.220
are so pretty now.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.340
What are you talking about?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.180
It's not about the certificate.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.080
It's our son-in-law and daughter
who are pretty.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.300
- Exactly.
- Sometimes

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.740
your mom

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.420
doesn't get to the point.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.540
Jianqi.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.750
It hasn't been easy for you two
to get here.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.620
We've watched it all these years.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.180
Now that you've gotten your certificate,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.660
you're family.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.540
You have to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.140
talk things out,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.540
and look out for each other.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.980
Don't fight.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.140
All couples

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.900
have their arguments.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.620
Right?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.060
That's fine.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.760
Just don't drag it on overnight.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.300
Yes. Husbands and wives
shouldn't go to bed angry.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.180
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.620
we won't fight.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.700
Even if we do, I'll be the first

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.980
to apologize.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.620
Wait.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.260
Why are you still calling us
Mr. Shen and Mrs. Shen?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.700
Dad.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.900
Mom.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.660
Jianqi,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.700
there's something

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.260
we've wanted to tell you
for a long time.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.860
We didn't know how.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.340
Actually, Mingzhu

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.580
isn't our biological daughter.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.460
But from the day we brought her home,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.340
we treated her

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.500
like our own.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.460
More than our own.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.340
So we named her

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.340
Shen Mingzhu.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.980
I hope you'll treat her well.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.660
What's wrong with you?

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.900
I'm talking to them.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.940
No.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.300
It's a happy day.
Why are you saying this?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.140
Come on.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.620
Say what you need to say.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.580
I'm done.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.500
You didn't get to the point.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.500
Back then, when we went to a village

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.620
to collect vegetables,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.700
there was a family
that had just had twins.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.540
They were struggling,
so they kept the son

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.940
and didn't want the daughter.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.700
So we took her home.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.420
Anyway, it's been so many years.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.260
There were no cell phones or WeChat

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.300
at that time.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.180
So we lost contact.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.740
Dad, Mom,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.700
don't worry.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.940
Whether Mingzhu is
your biological daughter

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.860
or not,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.420
I'm fine with it.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.060
I love Mingzhu.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.940
Minghui.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.060
What a coincidence.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.460
I just came from your place.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.620
Let me tell you.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.380
I'm officially
your brother-in-law today.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.640
Come on. Call me brother-in-law.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.860
Brother-in-law.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.260
Brother-in-law,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.820
can you lend me your car?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.580
Sure.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.980
Next time.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.240
Let me take a look.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.900
Let me take a look and share your luck.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.140
This is what they call
a perfect match.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.540
So pretty. So handsome.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.580
- Perfect match.
- Mingzhu.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.020
- Perfect match.
- He's handsome.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.860
Of course.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.060
Mingzhu

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.820
is our cherished pearl.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.100
We'll throw a big banquet.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.860
You all have to come
and share the joy.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.780
Of course.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.700
We'll be there.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.500
Mingzhu, where are you holding
the wedding banquet?

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.820
We haven't decided yet.
We'll let you all know once it's set.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.100
You must tell us.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.660
We will.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.580
My son-in-law's family has standards.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.980
They know how to do things properly.
We follow their lead.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.140
Of course.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.700
Do you know where their new home is?

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.540
- Don't know.
- Where?

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.580
Xin City Grand Court, you know it?

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.100
Really?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.500
- That's a luxury complex.
- A luxury complex.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.780
It's very expensive.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.780
- Yeah.
- Very expensive.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.900
Super expensive.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.340
Mom. Hey.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.300
What?

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.580
Tone it down.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.460
Mom, I'm back.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.500
I'm not bragging.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.620
I'm telling the truth, right?

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.020
Right.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.860
They're neighbors

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.820
who watched you grow up.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.140
Their new home is

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.980
(Shen Mingzhu)
right across from Fengqi's parents' place.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.260
- Really?
- That's convenient.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.740
Right.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.420
My daughter is so blessed.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.620
Unlike my son.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.300
What are we supposed to do with him?

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.460
They're so much different.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.700
Mom.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.740
Now that Mingzhu's married,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.780
can I move out of the attic?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.120
We'll talk about it later.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.500
Dad promised me when he renovated.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.260
Alright, alright.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.860
Let me tell you.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.580
My in-laws' daughter is overseas.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.460
Guess how big a house
my two in-laws live in?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.140
How would we know?

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.140
We can't guess.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.700
Just say it.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.900
Two hundred square meters.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900
For just the two of them.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.180
That big?

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.640
That big.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.220
Wouldn't they get lost inside the house?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.060
If it were me,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.860
I'd be scared to go to
the bathroom at night.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.820
- Exactly.
- Dad, the chives are cleaned.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.980
Coming. Good.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.100
Zhu,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.940
come home when you can.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.180
I'll always have your room ready.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.820
Hear that?

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.340
Mom.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.620
That's my room.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.820
Mom,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.980
I'll come home

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.460
every day.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.100
Good.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.660
Come on.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.940
Go upstairs and do your homework.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.220
You've been in high school
for five years.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.620
How much longer
are you planning to stay there?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.820
Minghui

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.180
wants to wear out
his Nanzhou High School uniform,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.980
right?

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.340
Dad.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.060
If you say it like that,
I feel no pressure at all now.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.260
(How are things on your side?)
Mr. Shen always looks on the bright side.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.220
(Sunny and bright)
Yeah, he doesn't take things too hard.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.540
(Feng Jianqi)

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.140
(Marriage Certificate)

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.060
Just four words.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.100
I have no words.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.020
Mom,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.700
Mingzhu doesn't care about our money.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.550
She likes me because I'm a good person.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.360
If our family weren't well-off,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.260
would we have been able
to raise you this well?

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.540
You dated her for three years.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.900
Your dad and I stayed silent.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.460
Anyone with a brain could tell

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.540
that no approval means objection.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.300
Any other girl would've left long ago.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.220
Why did Shen Mingzhu hold on
for so long?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.540
Because she's determined

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.660
to marry up.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.340
And now she's got what she wanted.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.340
Registered.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.700
Pregnant.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.980
The deal is sealed.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.660
Mom,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.740
I'm the one who got what I wanted.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.820
I chased Mingzhu for over three years.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.180
It was me who wouldn't let go.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.780
Feng Zhi,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.580
did you hear what he said?

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.020
You've lost your mind.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.980
You wouldn't listen to your own parents,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.300
but let a poor girl drag you around.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.580
You have a graduate degree
from a prestigious university.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.580
Think with your head, please.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.900
You've fallen into

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.140
her play-hard-to-get trap.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.340
Marriage is her stepping stone.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.700
Good for her.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.220
She went from rags to riches.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:44.900
Enough.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.900
They're married now.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.940
Whatever difference in status there was,
we're family now.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.580
Rags to riches?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.100
Don't say that again.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.060
We're forming a union,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.740
not a feud.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.260
Alright. That's the end of it.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.060
Jianqi,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.020
I'm curious.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.980
What do Mingzhu's parent think

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.380
about the wedding?

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.620
I mean,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.340
should both families

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.100
discuss it?

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.180
Right.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.860
You know,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.060
the wedding is important.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.860
Our guests

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.740
are all respected people.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.100
The guests her family invites

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.340
are probably regular folks.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.060
These two groups

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.580
have no overlap at all.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.620
If we put them together
at the wedding banquet,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.860
wouldn't it be ridiculous?

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.460
What if someone tries to ask for a favor

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.020
or borrow money

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.740
at the wedding?

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.380
And what if they get drunk

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.340
and start fighting?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.620
That's why

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.140
we need to sit down

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.860
and talk things through peacefully

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.500
to solve things properly.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.980
Jianqi,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.500
how about this?

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.660
Your mom and I will

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.580
visit Mingzhu's parents

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.820
this weekend.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.860
See if that works for them.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.820
Alright, I'll tell her.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.180
And there's another thing.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.780
It's troublesome.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.660
Shen Mingzhu

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.380
was adopted.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.500
What if her biological parents
show up on the wedding day?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.940
Not only would you suddenly
get another pair of parents,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.060
but you might also be getting
a bunch of siblings.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.240
What are you going to do then?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.540
Heavens.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.500
She'd better not drag my son
into this mess.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.140
Mom,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.460
what if Mingzhu's a lost princess?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.020
Then I'd be a prince consort.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.260
Out.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.700
Ni,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.620
you really got some skills.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.740
- Of course.
- I look great.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.540
Can someone get me a sharpener?

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.060
I'll go get it.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.780
Ni, I'll go.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:45.620
I'll get it for you, Ni.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.260
Look at my influence.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.940
My dad handles funerals,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.980
and I handle weddings.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.260
The Ni family does

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.740
all kinds of ceremonies.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.660
Xiaoni knows how to take pulses.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.180
She can treat patients too.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.060
You know what?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.340
Nanzhou would be paralyzed

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.500
without the Ni family.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.540
Totally paralyzed.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.740
Xiaoni's amazing.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.540
She figured out I was pregnant.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.180
I know, right?

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.820
She learned that from me.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.290
I could take a pulse since I was a kid.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.980
I got it from my mom,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.420
and Xiaoni got it from her mom.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.420
My dad is really something.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.340
After searching all his life,
he ended up with the same type of wife.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.540
Both of them are fierce.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.500
Stop it. If your mom hears you,
she'll kill you.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.020
It's fine. She knows.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.180
Xiaoni's mom is very fierce.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.060
Just like my mom

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.320
- when she was young.
- Really?

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.620
(Family Harmony Brings Prosperity)
Look at her. She's laughing.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.100
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.940
These two girls grew up together.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.460
How did the gap get so big?

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.820
Don't say that.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.300
Ni's great, right?

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.100
Yes, she is.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.980
I've been working
in the marriage bureau all my life.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.220
Is there ever a guy like Feng Jianqi?

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.900
Yes, but rare.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.620
Your daughter really found a treasure.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.260
Her life's going to be
sweeter than honey.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.100
Come on. Look at the bride.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.220
Isn't she pretty?

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.700
Yes.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.580
Mingzhu,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.820
you look exactly like a bride.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.260
Ni did my makeup.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.180
Ni's talented, isn't she?

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.740
She runs her own business.
So capable.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.620
Don't worry.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.300
It's pointless.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.220
She doesn't know how to date.
Every relationship she starts fails.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.860
Mom,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.340
stop introducing me

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.260
to those weird guys

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.940
with weird looks.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.180
I want to date a decent guy.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.540
Introduce someone like Feng Jianqi.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.780
You'd need that kind of luck first.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.380
Dad, let me help you.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.060
No. It's dirty.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.540
- Jianqi, you're here.
- Mom.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.340
Hello, everyone.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.820
I'm here to pick up Mingzhu.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.980
You're here, Jianqi.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.820
There's only one Feng Jianqi.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.420
Go on.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.020
"There's only one Feng Jianqi."

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.820
We're leaving.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.020
Come back early.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.740
Have fun.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.140
Look how lovey-dovey they are.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.340
Look at them,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.380
and look at you.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.340
What's wrong with me?

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.300
I'm perfectly fine.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:53.940
Try harder.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.740
These things depend on fate.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.060
I have to keep an eye on you,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.700
or someone's going to steal you away.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.500
We're legally married.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.500
No one steals me away.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.660
Right, dear.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.660
My parents want to visit your parents

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.700
and discuss the wedding.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.460
Is this weekend okay?

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.780
Why did they suddenly
change their attitude?

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.140
Do they know I was adopted?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.420
Of course they know.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.300
They now think you're a lost princess.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.700
Really?

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.420
Really.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.660
You know what, dear?

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.780
I actually think

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.860
happiness is really simple.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.500
I walk outside,
and the road feels familiar.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.180
I reach out,
and the person I love is there.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.260
I come home to warm food waiting

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.380
and a house full of noise and family.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.660
We can

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.300
earn a little, spend a little,
and save a little.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.340
Living a simple and steady life.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.620
I could do that forever.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.380
Me too.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.620
Ni, you'd better hurry up
and find someone.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.420
When you were little,
your grades were better than Mingzhu's.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.860
Now that you've grown up,
you can't fall behind.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.740
Yes, yes.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.660
The sooner you die,
the sooner you reincarnate.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.060
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.300
I'm just kidding.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.180
Dad's photo has been hanging
on the wall for years,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.980
and he's still alive and kicking,
isn't he?

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.020
The time hasn't come yet.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.860
You and Dad divorced.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.820
That means you were
never a good match.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.980
Not a good match?

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.820
Even though we didn't match,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.940
that doesn't give Ni Debao the right
to fool around.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.380
Do the math.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.180
When did I divorce him?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.340
And when

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.300
was Ni Xiaoni born?

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.220
Once you count it out, you know exactly
when he and Xiaoni's mom

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.500
started messing around.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.820
Shameless.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.980
He had an affair!

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.940
He cheated on me,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.740
and after the divorce,
he just up and left.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.380
And me?

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.420
I was the one left humiliated.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.500
My life has been suffering.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.100
Mom, even if life is hard for you,
you can't blame everything on him.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.220
It's been so many years.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.900
It's time to let go of the hate.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.220
You know nothing.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.620
Meow meow.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.340
Dad,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.180
please try to understand.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.700
(Ni's Clinic)

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.140
Dad, Ni is offering incense
to you again.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:21.900
Xiaoni,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.460
look how filial your sister is.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.140
You must learn from her,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.940
okay?

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.620
Okay.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.100
Learn what?

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.020
Burn incense for you?

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.460
Every day we open the window,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.660
the first thing we see is your photo.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.420
It's like we're living with a ghost.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.180
Why don't you talk to Ni's mom?

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.780
It's been so many years.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.420
Just let it go.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.940
If I could talk things out with her,

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.140
why would you be here at all?

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:58.700
You!

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.020
What's it?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.420
Can your roof still hold up?

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.130
Even your memorial portrait could hang
up there, why wouldn't my roof hold?

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.060
You spitfire.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.340
Let me tell you something strange.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.220
I went to the countryside
for a funeral.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.600
We waited three days and three nights,

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.260
and the old lady still hasn't passed.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.100
All the relatives
only took three days off.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.460
They're getting anxious.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.780
The wick hasn't burned out yet.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.740
Those five years of high school
didn't go to waste, huh?

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.220
But nobody uses oil lamps anymore.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.740
So everyone starts guessing

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.500
what she's waiting for.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.580
Is she waiting for her grandson
in the US?

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.100
But that grandson

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.100
broke his rib playing basketball.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.980
He can barely get out of bed,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.160
let alone come to the funeral.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.060
Mr. Ni,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.380
you want me to pretend
to be that grandson?

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.540
Clever.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.060
My sister just got married,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.720
and you want me to go to a funeral now?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.340
If my dad finds out,
he'll break my legs.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.660
There's money.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.140
Besides, the old lady's over a hundred.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.740
That counts as a celebratory funeral.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.340
Will that be a lot?

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.300
When have I ever shorted you?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.380
Alright, then.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.100
What do you want to say?

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.700
Dacheng.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.780
Alright.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.620
Dacheng? Dacheng!

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.740
Mom's calling you.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.820
You two stay.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.820
We'll stay.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.260
The rest

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.740
go out.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.020
Mr. Ni,

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.340
do you still need me here?

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.260
Doesn't look like it.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.780
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.300
Go.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.020
They came out.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.740
Why are you all coming out?

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.460
They're out.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.180
Why did Mom

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.740
ask Jingxiang and her husband to stay?

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.340
Is she giving them her last words?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.700
Well.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.380
Eldest brother,

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.220
is she leaving them something?

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.940
No.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.100
Mom never worked.
She saved every penny her whole life.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.020
Do you want the old house

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.100
which is the only thing she has?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.140
Hey.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:22:00.620
I'm so sorry.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.420
I'm so sorry.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.220
What?

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.020
My daughter!

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.620
Is Mom calling me?

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.860
How could you do that?

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.060
Give me back my daughter!

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.100
Mom!

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.260
Mom!

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.540
Get ready.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.950
It's a celebratory funeral!
Make it lively!

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.260
(Nanxi Hotel)

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.060
Mom.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.700
Sit.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.260
The wedding hasn't been held yet.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.980
Call me Mrs. Feng.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.140
Mrs. Feng,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.650
what did you want to talk to me about?

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.850
You're pregnant now.
Why are you still working?

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.180
I'm good.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.180
I haven't felt anything.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.620
No morning sickness so far.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.860
Impressive.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.660
The daughter of a restaurant owner

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.900
is tough indeed.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.340
But you're pregnant now.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.620
You need to take care of yourself.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.300
This is a top-grade bird's nest.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.340
Meiqi and I have been eating it.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.780
You should have some too.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.900
Have you had a bird's nest before?

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.020
Does your mom know how to cook it?

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.220
I've never had it,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.620
and I don't really want it.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.220
My mom doesn't know how to cook it.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:07.940
She should learn.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.500
It's easy.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.660
Have your mom learn.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.900
You need to nourish your body.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.460
You're carrying
the Feng family's grandson.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.420
It could be a girl.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.500
That's fine.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.220
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
I'll love them.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.660
Anyway, you can have more kids now.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.540
Just focus on giving birth.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.920
We'll help you raise the children.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.980
Don't feel any pressure.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.300
I don't feel pressured.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.380
As long as it's my child,
I'll love them.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.340
Of course.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.300
All parents

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.780
love their own children the most.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.220
When Jianqi graduated,

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.060
we bought him a new apartment.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.260
The deed only has his name on it.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.460
You know that, right?

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.220
I do.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.140
I won't ask to have my name added.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.580
Good.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.860
I came today

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.260
because

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.020
Jianqi's dad and I will
visit your family

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.180
this Saturday.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.340
I was worried your parents
might feel uncomfortable,

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.100
so I wanted to ask you first.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.220
Have your biological parents
come to look for you?

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.380
No.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.460
I've always felt my parents
are my real parents.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.620
That's how you feel.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.380
But what if they show up

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.740
after you get married?

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.580
I don't know.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.940
We'll deal with it when it happens.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.100
If you don't think ahead,
you'll soon run into trouble.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.220
You know that, don't you?

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.620
Marrying into a family like ours,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.180
you need to start thinking long-term.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.340
I understand, Mrs. Feng.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.860
Dad.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.100
Have you got all the furniture?

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.700
Yes. Just bought a new bed.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.450
What do you think?

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.500
It's sturdy.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.720
It only looks like so.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.100
You should've bought solid wood
in the furniture market.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.620
Mingzhu likes it.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.380
And you?

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.780
If she likes it, I like it.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.260
I'll let you get back to it.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.060
Sure.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.140
Mr. Feng.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.160
You're here, Mingzhu.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.020
The elevator needs a keycard,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.460
so Jianqi got me one.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.700
Right, you need one.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.940
Otherwise, it's inconvenient.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.540
Why did I hear someone
still calling "Mr. Feng"?

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.860
It's just a form of address.
Doesn't matter.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.840
I'll leave you guys to it.
I'll head back.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.500
Are you tired today?

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.420
No.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.580
Your mom came.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.740
I called her "Mom,"

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.340
and she said I should wait
until after the wedding banquet.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.980
What's wrong with her?

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.140
Did she give you a hard time?

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.900
No. She gave me a bird's nest.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.230
♪What you said before♪

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.100
Done.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.060
Well done.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.460
It feels great.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.420
We can hang our wedding photo
on this wall.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.220
Isn't it usually hung over the bed?

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.180
Why would you hang it here?

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.620
So that I can see this picture
when I lie down.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.180
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.980
It doesn't take much to make you happy.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.460
There's a custom back in my hometown.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.520
At weddings and funerals,

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.820
the person with the most blessings
sits at the main table.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.260
I'm the blessed person now.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.260
Look.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.460
I have a father, a mother, a sister,

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.460
a wife, and a child on the way.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.140
Then I'm also a blessed person.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.900
Baby,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.640
your mom and dad

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.100
get to sit at the main table
and get served eat the best food

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.860
whenever they go.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.060
Say, dear,

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.460
if you find your birth parents,

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.180
you'll have four parents.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.940
That's Blessed Pro.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.420
And maybe a bunch of siblings,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.180
nieces, and nephews.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.580
That'd be incredible.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.140
The Queen of the Blessed.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.140
Blessed Pro Max.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.140
Please have the family's blessed person
burn the paper to show respect.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.260
Grandma,

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.940
Yu Jun broke his rib
and can't come back.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.980
I'll pay respect on his behalf.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.500
May you rest in peace.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.060
(Forever in Our Hearts)

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.660
(In Mourning)

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.340
Family and friends,

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.220
please bow.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.140
Grandma loved Yu Jun the most.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.940
She couldn't even close her eyes.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.580
Bow again.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.460
It wasn't because of him.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.140
You have a sister.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.060
Bow again.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.060
What sister?

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.180
Zhidong,

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.860
you have

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.780
a twin sister.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.900
Please observe a moment of silence.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.420
My second daughter.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.940
There, there.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.340
There, there, Mom.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.940
Not bad.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.780
Look. The building has a vintage look,
and there are flowers everywhere.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.420
Right?

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.860
Mustard greens with shredded pork.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.540
Thank you, Xiu'e.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.580
Alright. Thank you.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.140
Vegetable with fragrant mushrooms
is their specialty.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:23.980
Try it.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.940
Besides,

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.500
the environment and the design...

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.300
Look at Mingzhu.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.580
She breezed through

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.780
Grade 10 piano.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.060
You never let me learn.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:34.940
If I'd learned,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.380
I would've passed it too.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.420
Oh, come on.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.660
Grade 10?

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.900
Your mom and I will be grateful enough
if you don't repeat the year.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.100
Mr. Shen,

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.060
here's what you asked for.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.180
There we go.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.180
- Let me see.
- It's here.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:49.980
How's it?

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.420
Let me see.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.740
Check if this is right.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.350
Thank you so much, Wang.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.460
Here, have a cigarette.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.380
No, thanks.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.460
Shen, look at this.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.900
These are not wild sea cucumbers.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:06.860
I'll be honest.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.140
Wild ones are rare.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.060
It needs luck.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.940
These here are top-quality.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.740
The abalones

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.340
are too small.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.300
Bigger abalones

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.100
aren't worth it.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.540
They're too expensive.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.100
Expensive is fine.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.820
We don't mind.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.300
We're having important guests.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:23.860
Exactly.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.780
It's fine.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.860
These are good enough.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.020
No. They're too small.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.780
I'll go exchange them.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.940
I'll do it.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.460
Alright.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.660
Thank you, Wang.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.660
Sorry about that.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.860
Don't say that. We're friends.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.860
Thank you.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.020
(In Loving Memory)

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:37.660
Mr. Zhang,

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.580
do you want to keep those
leftover cigarettes, wine, and drinks,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.180
or should I return them?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.060
I'll ask.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:47.780
Zhixia.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.340
Zhixia.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.700
The person in charge is asking

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.020
what to do with
the leftover beers and cigarettes.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.820
Mom, sit for bit.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.420
What was it again?

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.560
Should we return
those leftover beers and cigarettes?

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.320
Why are you asking me
about something this trivial?

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.620
You ask me about everything.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.940
Can't you help me out for once?

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.260
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.420
What would you do without me?

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.580
My wife has a quick temper.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.220
She gets fired up easily.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.680
I suspect she has
ascendant hyperactivity of the liver.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.300
Not necessarily.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.740
Let me take her pulse.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.780
You can do that?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.220
Mrs. Zhang,

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.620
your complexion doesn't look great.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.260
How about I take your pulse?

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.780
Your business scope is quite wide.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.020
Treating patients is my main job.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.100
Let him try.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.780
Well?

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.820
Oh my.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.500
It's pregnancy pulse.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.820
Pregnancy pulse?

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.700
Yeah, pregnancy pulse.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.740
What's that, Mom?

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.660
You're getting a little sibling.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.460
Let me check it again.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.420
I don't want a sibling.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.460
I want a dog.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.660
You can just raise me.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.780
Xiu'e, Mr. Shen.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.380
You're here.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.740
The loquats they're selling
at the entrance are pretty good.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.060
Freshly picked.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.300
I saw Wang just now.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.220
What's going on here?

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.100
Are you going to prepare a whole feast?

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:26.980
No.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.220
Xiu'e still thinks it's not enough.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.020
Our in-laws

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.660
are no ordinary people.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.380
We can't just serve any old meal.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.460
Any old meal?

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.740
My cooking is top-notch.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.980
They only get flavors like mine
at the Hilton.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.100
Stop bragging.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.220
Bragging costs you nothing.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.620
Shen does have some skills.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.700
You know me.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.700
Look at this.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.740
I suspect

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.420
they're looking for Mingzhu.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:54.940
What's this?

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.380
(Family Search Notice)

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.900
(Dad and Mom are looking for you.
We hope you can come home soon.)

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.420
Mom,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.620
I've given my second daughter a name.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:12.980
Zhilu.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.460
I hope she knows the way home.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.660
My girl didn't get lost by herself.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.820
Your mother who gave her away.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.460
If anyone needs to find their way,
it should be your mother.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.080
How is my girl supposed
to find anything?

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.820
I really don't understand.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:33.660
How could she hide something this big
right up until she died?

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.260
You're the one to blame.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.500
You got arrested for fighting

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.060
and went to prison for years.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.260
That's why my mother
gave the child away.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.780
It's your fault.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.260
Nonsense!

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.500
You talk nonsense!

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.460
There are tons of people
who've been to jail.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.060
That doesn't mean

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.260
my mother-in-law

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.060
could just hand my daughter
to someone else.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.540
I'm telling you, Yu Jingxiang.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.060
If we can't get our daughter back,

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.340
I'll never visit your mother's grave.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.780
No one with the surname Xu is going.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.340
Dad, going to prison isn't
something to brag about.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.580
I heard you from far away.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.780
Stop arguing. It's only been a few days
since Grandma died.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.380
Gosh.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.420
You're a Xu.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.860
You can't go.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.380
What's wrong with being a Xu?

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.980
Is being a Xu such a big deal now?

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.850
Anyone with the surname Xu
aren't allowed to go?

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.740
Zhidong,

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.220
don't listen to your dad.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.340
Listen.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.020
Back then,

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.340
you had a high fever,

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.820
you know?

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.780
You almost died.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.300
Your grandma stayed by your side,

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.140
wiping your chest and your back
with hot water,

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.180
watching over you day and night
for seven whole days.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.420
She pulled you back from death's door.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.540
Without her, there wouldn't be you.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.220
You understand?

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.060
Yes, I know.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.580
Zhidong.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.300
Without me, there wouldn't be you.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:35.580
Jeez,

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.340
your grandma

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.020
favored boys over girls.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.340
I...

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.580
Your twin sister was sent away
because of you.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.420
If we never find her,

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.740
you're not going to marry someone.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.340
Fine, fine. It's all my fault.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:46.900
What does this

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.260
have to do with Zhidong?

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.580
Are you out of your mind?

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.260
You're barking at anyone.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.060
Back then,

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.860
I was in an emergency,

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.180
and you were in prison.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.580
Taking care of three kids alone
was impossible.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.180
My mother had no choice.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.020
How is that "favoring boys over girls"?

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.580
It was random.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.340
Yu Jingxiang,

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.700
you gave your child away!

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.980
And you call that random?

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.380
Do you hear yourself?

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.020
Were you drawing lottery tickets?

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.020
Random, you say?

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.180
Everyone knew

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.300
your mother favored boys.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.300
Even the lady at the general store knew.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.460
When they were little,

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.660
five candies for one yuan,

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.500
he was always the one
who got the extra piece.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.020
If that's not favoritism, then what is?

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.580
Yet you still
have the nerve to bring this up.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.100
Don't talk like that.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.180
How could I not know
how hard your mother had it?

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.540
When she was bedridden all those years,

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.900
I was the one who washed her

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.020
and carried her

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.260
up and down the hospital stairs,

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.260
from the first floor to the fourth
and back again.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.380
You should have.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.100
You were paying for what you did.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.740
Then how does your mother pay for hers?

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.940
Xu Dacheng, I'm telling you,
once Zhidong gets married,

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.700
I'm

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.900
divorcing you.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.060
Even if he doesn't,
I'll still divorce you.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.340
Fine. Divorce, then!

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.340
How much is Ming's school bag?

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.500
360,000.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.260
Ming's school bag cost 360,000?

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.180
What does his family do?

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.460
How can a school bag be 360,000?

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.780
They own a mine.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.060
Erase it and do it again.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.980
They own a mine?

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.580
What's the result?

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.100
Jiao,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.420
you're going to be a big sister.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.100
Look here.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.540
Do you want a little brother
or a little sister?

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.740
I want a dog.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.060
Oh, you kid.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.780
Mom,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.300
can we get a dog?

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.260
No matter if you have a sibling or not,

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.060
we're not getting a dog.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.580
Why not?

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.060
Wang Ziqian has a dog.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.820
She got full marks on her test.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:11.980
Jiao,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.140
don't make my wife upset.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.740
Zhixia,

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.300
you can't talk to the girl like that.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.540
I don't know how to raise kids at all,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.980
so we can't have a second child.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.580
My parents are fighting again.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.820
I need to stabilize the situation.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.820
Jiao, do your homework.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.820
I'll check it later.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.100
All right.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.620
Be careful when you go out.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.300
All right?

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.620
You're not alone now.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.260
Are those flat shoes?

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.020
Good. Wear flats.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.020
I'll go with you.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.620
No need...

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:38.660
Hey, what are you doing?

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.420
Slow down.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:44.980
Zhixia.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.860
Put it out.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:54.780
Dad,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.300
Grandma was the one
who gave the baby away,

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.540
not Mom.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.840
Why are you snapping at her?

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.900
You bark at the wrong tree.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.060
Of course I know

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.580
I should be blaming your grandma.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.980
But where am I supposed to find her?

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.300
I can't believe
she hid something this big.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.780
She's a con artist!

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.140
Dad!

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:10.660
Zhixia,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.100
listen to what nonsense he just said.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.860
Mom, can you also stop?

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.980
You're all riled up
the second Zhixia comes back.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.780
Whose side are you on, Zhidong?

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.740
Grandma should've
given you away instead.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.980
Mom, can you stop attacking everyone?

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.740
Zhidong's doing fine now.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.940
He knows how to work hard.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.660
He's about to marry Bichen.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.020
He's

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.660
a grown man.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.860
Don't talk about him like that.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.980
His twin sister

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.220
was sent away many years ago.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.620
It's not like
she can be found overnight.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.820
Besides, human traffickers
don't read newspapers now.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.580
They won't call us.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.380
I had Zhang Hao post a notice online.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.940
Everyone can see it.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.180
We'll definitely hear something.
Let's wait.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.460
Yes, we'll wait for it.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.060
Zhixia,

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.380
what if

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.500
she never comes back?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.410
If she never comes back,

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.220
we'll all go confront your mother
down there.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.540
Did you hear that?

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.220
I didn't even say anything, Zhixia.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.340
If she doesn't come back,

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.380
that means she's living well.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.380
Zhidong is her twin brother.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.060
Now that Zhidong has a girlfriend,

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.940
she might be getting married soon.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:20.660
Right.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.140
If she has a good, blessed life,

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.820
why would she bother coming back

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.420
to parents who gave her away?

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.620
A mother full of negative energy,

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.180
a father who blows up at everything,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.060
a useless twin brother

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.300
who can only

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.380
cry for help,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.900
and me, the miserable older sister.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.500
I'm pregnant now.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.420
Can you not make me upset?

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.540
Zhixia,

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.180
calm down.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:46.900
Zhixia.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.300
Mom, Dad, I'm going with Jianqi
to try on wedding dresses.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.300
Take some photos
and show your mom later.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.700
Alright. I'm going, Mom.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.460
- Take care.
- Well.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.620
Don't run.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.620
What's wrong with you?

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.660
You've broken two glasses.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.500
I'm not knocking it hard.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.020
Do you know why Ni's mom came?

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.740
Wasn't she here to give us loquats?

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.020
No. She...

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.860
She brought a newspaper.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.900
There's a missing person notice in it.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.980
I think they're looking for
our daughter.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.660
The birthdate

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.740
and the address

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.020
all match.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:48.580
Look.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.460
- How nice.
- The baby is born, right?

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.380
We came to take a look.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.100
Come on. Let's see.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.100
Lower your voices.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.340
Look.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.020
So adorable.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.340
Cutie.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.100
Cutie.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.580
- Have you given her a name?
- Yes.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.060
What's it?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:00.860
Mingzhu.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.220
Shen Mingzhu.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.100
That's nice. A good name.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.420
A cherished pearl in the palm.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.260
Mingzhu was born by me,

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.420
right?

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.740
Yes.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.420
Mingzhu is your birth daughter.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.740
It's been almost thirty years.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.180
Not a single word all this time.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:20.940
Why now?

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.940
She's about to get married.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.860
Why would they suddenly look for her?

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.500
If they find her,

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.940
what do we do?

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.740
Mingzhu

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.420
is our daughter.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.100
No matter who comes for her,
we won't admit it.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.740
Right.
