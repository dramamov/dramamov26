=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.700
=Episode 7=

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.330
Excuse me.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.330
Is Dr. Li here?

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.409
Yes, he is.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.369
He's in Exam Room 8, right?

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:30.890
Yes.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.810
Thank you.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.120
Please come in.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.569
Dr. Li,

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:40.810
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.649
No. Come in.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.289
You're eating this for lunch?

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.009
I was busy. I didn't have time
to go down for lunch.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.489
Just grabbing a bite.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.649
You can't eat spicy sticks for lunch.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:59.690
Have this.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.730
My mom packed me a work meal.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.610
I was supposed to be back at the office,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.489
but my superior
made me go home and rest.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.530
I'll eat when I get home.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.249
What kind of great leader is that?

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.290
Well, I'll take it.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.089
Go ahead.

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.369
I thought your follow-up was next week.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.769
Yeah, next week.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.730
I came today to ask

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.515
if you could write me a sick leave note
for interstitial pregnancy.

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:25.093
My superior wants me to take sick leave.

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:26.610
I'm afraid that if someone checks,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.610
he'll get blamed.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.170
I see. I'll write it for you.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.209
Thank you.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.410
They're still warm.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.529
Thank you.

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:46.170
Give this to your company.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.730
Get it stamped at the triage desk.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.950
The procedure is correct,
and it's good for your leader.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.489
You've got experience in this.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:52.610
Thank you.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.330
Li Jingzhe!

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:54.969
Li Jingzhe!

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:55.890
Come out!

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.290
Come out, Li Jingzhe!

00:02:58.426 --> 00:02:59.760
He must be hiding in his office.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.440
Definitely here.

00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:01.670
­ Who's that?
- Li Jingzhe!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.469
Li Jingzhe!

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.050
Hospital brawl.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.640
I'll take you out through the back door.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:05.529
Li Jingzhe!

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:08.369
There's a back door?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.520
- This is a hospital.
- Don't touch me!

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:13.450
Please calm down, madam.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.890
- The nurse hits me!
- Get off me.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.850
Please calm down.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.369
Li Jingzhe!

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:17.489
Please calm down, madam.

00:03:18.337 --> 00:03:19.570
- Where's he?
- Li Jingzhe!

00:03:21.182 --> 00:03:22.360
- Li Jingzhe!
- Li Jingzhe!

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:35.570
Are you okay?

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.969
Do you guys often run into this?

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:40.570
Not quite.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.330
Last month,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.010
a patient had a placental abruption.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.689
The baby didn't survive.

00:03:45.848 --> 00:03:47.026
The family couldn't accept it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.890
and keeps coming back
to make trouble every few days.

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:50.760
I'm one of the few male doctors
in the department,

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.089
young and fast enough to run.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.969
So they sent me to handle it.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.850
I see.

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.969
Are you really okay?

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.170
I'm good.

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.529
Right now, I'm doing two things at once.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.610
Saving lives on one hand,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.290
and mapping out the hospital
on the other,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.010
ready to escape anytime.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.290
That hallway leads to the morgue.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.569
Nobody goes there.

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.290
I was on the phone there that day.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.610
Didn't expect to run into you.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.889
If it weren't for death stuff,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.329
I wouldn't have gone there.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:28.569
You know,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.090
that day something occurred to me.

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:33.449
If only my husband had cheated on me.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.320
As long as he was still alive,

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:37.210
everything else wouldn't matter.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.249
What if

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:45.515
he really cheats on you?

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:50.650
I'd wish him well.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.610
That's typical for a mom-to-be.

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.329
Your heart is
big enough to float a boat.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.226
Hearts only get that big
because the boat pushes them open.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.170
Every stroke hurts,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.410
but you still have to keep rowing.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.410
Is it hard for you right now?

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:19.689
It's okay.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.090
Do you have someone to talk to
when you're upset?

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.210
No one.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:36.770
Someone dies.

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:39.569
People die every day.

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.170
So we have to live well,

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:46.369
right?

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:49.170
Yeah.

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:57.449
Blind dates? Oh, Mom.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.489
I'll find someone myself.

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:00.569
Don't worry about it.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.650
I promise you'll be satisfied, okay?

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.090
Fate can't be rushed.

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.770
Oh my.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.290
I'm hanging up.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.210
Hello.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.493
What line is this?
[* "Line" sounds like "filling" in Mandarin]

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.650
Pork and scallion. What's wrong?

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:22.770
I'm asking, what line is this?

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.770
Solid line.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.249
I'm sorry.

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:27.689
I'm sorry. I'll move right away.

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.770
Mingzhu!

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.210
Hurry up. The traffic police are here.

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:36.650
We're moving.

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:39.569
Alright.

00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:40.730
I won't deduct points.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.689
Just a 200 yuan fine.

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:43.090
No, please.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.650
My friend's pregnant.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.489
She can't walk fast.

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:46.770
Yes, I'm pregnant.

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:48.480
Do you have an ultrasound photo?

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:49.610
Show it to the officer.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.689
It's real.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.569
She's pregnant.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.970
Alright. Move along.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.004
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:56.982
Don't do it next time.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.689
Sure. Thank you, handsome officer.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.679
Li Store's meat buns are amazing.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.004
One bite and the juice bursts out.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.410
You know what?
I ran into a hospital brawl just now.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.569
It was scary.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.009
Hospital brawls

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.889
are meant to scare people.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.009
If you get scared,

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:22.249
they win.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:23.369
You should say this.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.929
"Come on. Come at me.

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:26.170
I'm pregnant.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.329
If you win, you'll support me
and the baby for life.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.040
If you lose, I'll support you for life."

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.000
Then you win.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.369
What would I do without you?

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.170
Everyone can live without someone.

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:39.050
You can live without Feng Jianqi too.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.369
You don't have to remind me. I know.

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:47.689
My birth parents gave me away,

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:48.569
and I survived.

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:51.050
So I'll survive anything.

00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:25.530
You've found your sister?

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.809
I'd say it's one-sided.

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:29.609
We're not sure yet.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.809
I thought you were twins.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.490
You don't really look alike though.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.530
Right? I don't think so either.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.648
But my parents think we do,

00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:39.490
especially my mom.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.250
She's being dramatic.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.909
She can see all thirty years

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.250
of hardship the girl's been through

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.490
by reading her face.

00:09:45.849 --> 00:09:47.650
She wanted to rush over overnight.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.929
If I were your mom

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.170
and found out

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.449
I had another daughter at fifty,

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:53.050
I'd rush over overnight too.

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:54.170
I wouldn't wait a minute.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.410
I can understand.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.650
Why didn't my grandma

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.050
tell her earlier?

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.130
Zhidong,

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:06.920
if your grandma hadn't preferred boys
over girls,

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:08.770
the one sent away might've been you.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.050
That's possible.

00:10:11.804 --> 00:10:13.379
Let's go eat at Shen's Restaurant.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.010
Take a look at
what your sister looks like.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.290
See if she looks like you.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.969
She's your biological sister.

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:21.490
Aren't you curious?

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.603
Even if she is,

00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:25.626
that doesn't mean
she wants to acknowledge me.

00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:27.130
I can't just show up like that.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.650
They said online

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.609
she's pregnant.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.569
That'd add to her pressure.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.050
True.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.290
Your little bag.

00:10:55.209 --> 00:10:56.089
I'm heading home.

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:56.849
Get home safe.

00:10:56.849 --> 00:10:57.890
Just leaving like this?

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.890
Bye-bye.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:05.969
Bye-bye.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.840
(If your grandma
hadn't favored boys over girls,)

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.729
(the one sent away might've been you.)

00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:17.530
(She's your biological sister.)

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.170
(Aren't you curious?)

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.609
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:35.650
Darling.

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:39.209
Your dad bought your favorite durian.

00:11:39.604 --> 00:11:41.650
It's so expensive.
Only he would buy it for you.

00:11:42.689 --> 00:11:43.329
Dad.

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:44.410
You're home.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.410
Sit and try it.

00:11:45.969 --> 00:11:46.689
Eat some fruit.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.410
We're having dumplings
and wontons tonight.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.449
You've wrapped so many.

00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:52.849
Did Zhidong send you home?

00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:55.680
You're going to get married
sooner or later.

00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:57.449
Both families will have to meet

00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:58.569
and talk.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.530
What's the rush?

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:01.729
The girl's side

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.290
shouldn't bring it up first.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.449
Bichen's not worried
about finding a husband.

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:07.130
Yeah.

00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:09.170
Says who?

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.770
The Xu family is all busy
looking for their daughter now.

00:12:11.969 --> 00:12:13.370
They don't care about their son.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.370
They do care.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.770
One thing at a time.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.770
I don't want to eat.

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:20.490
The situation in Xu Zhidong's family
is too complicated.

00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:22.050
If I had known earlier,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.490
I would never have let Bichen date him.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.410
(Shen Family Restaurant)

00:12:49.026 --> 00:12:50.050
What are you doing here?

00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:52.960
What are you doing in front of my house?

00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:56.440
I'm talking to you. Can't you hear me?

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.329
Who are you?

00:12:58.329 --> 00:12:59.130
Don't run!

00:13:00.337 --> 00:13:01.250
Sneaking photos again?

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.809
Who are you?

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.250
Talk! What are you doing here?

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.569
Hey.

00:13:07.826 --> 00:13:08.840
What's wrong with you?

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:10.010
Who are you?

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:11.729
Who the heck are you?

00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:12.650
Sneaking photos again?

00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:14.770
Let go.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.130
You're hitting me?

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.370
Here. Your ID cards.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:32.969
Thank you.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.849
(Xu Zhidong, March 26, 1994)

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:36.609
This is yours.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.530
You have the same birthday as my sister.

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:48.089
From Nanzhou?

00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:51.449
Which part of Nanzhou?

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.449
Why did you try to run away?

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.770
Who are your parents?

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.609
Where's your hometown?

00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.929
Why are you asking so much?

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:02.209
You don't get to ask.

00:14:03.729 --> 00:14:04.929
Who's coming for you?

00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:06.115
- My sister.
- My sister.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.890
Where is he?

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.890
Ask them.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:13.689
Officer.

00:14:13.689 --> 00:14:14.929
- Get in line.
- I'm Xu...

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.010
There's a queue here.

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:17.729
Line up.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:22.469
Where's Zhidong? Is he all right?

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.760
Don't worry, Mom.
Zhidong was the one who got beaten.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.250
We're in the right here. Don't worry.

00:14:26.982 --> 00:14:28.800
Someone from your family caused trouble?

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.849
No. It's not that.

00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:32.849
We were the ones who got attacked.

00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:34.329
We're the victims.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.770
Was it two young guys fighting?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.809
With Hui.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.809
Hui?

00:14:40.969 --> 00:14:41.969
You don't know him?

00:14:41.969 --> 00:14:42.849
No.

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.890
That brat is trouble.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.199
He spent five years in high school
and still didn't graduate.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.560
Everyone in the neighborhood
has suffered because of him.

00:14:50.737 --> 00:14:52.530
He even went after
his own brother-in-law.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.929
He stuck this huge snake

00:14:53.929 --> 00:14:55.650
into his brother-in-law's pants.

00:14:56.609 --> 00:14:57.209
What...

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.729
What happened to the brother-in-law?

00:14:59.729 --> 00:15:00.530
He died.

00:15:06.929 --> 00:15:08.809
Your brother's an honest lad,

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:10.530
and now he's caught up with that brat.

00:15:10.729 --> 00:15:12.969
We're in real trouble.

00:15:12.969 --> 00:15:13.689
It's okay, Mom.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.010
I'm here.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.990
Have the families
of Xu Zhidong and Shen Minghui arrived?

00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:19.737
Yes.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.370
Come with me.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.250
Where are we going?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.370
Mingzhu, that guy's family is here.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.660
I just told them

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.950
about Minghui's glorious history.

00:15:33.969 --> 00:15:35.089
They were probably scared.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.449
They won't push him anymore.

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:37.449
Hurry over.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.410
Shen Minghui. Xu Zhidong.

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:40.729
Come out.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.800
- You've arrived?
- Zhidong.

00:15:41.809 --> 00:15:42.290
I'll come fetch you.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.849
Zhidong.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.449
Poor Zhidong.

00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:45.370
Why did you come, Mom?

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.650
Zhidong, you...

00:15:46.782 --> 00:15:48.315
Why are you beaten up like this?

00:15:48.609 --> 00:15:50.089
Your clothes are torn.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.839
Shen Minghui's family isn't here yet.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.871
When his family gets here,

00:15:52.937 --> 00:15:54.050
we'll sort this out together.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.969
Thank you, officer.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.209
Come with me.

00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:01.490
Mom, you go back first.

00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:03.600
I'm not leaving.
I can't leave your sister alone.

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:04.290
You hit him?

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:05.490
We fought.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.782
My brother's always been honest.

00:16:06.804 --> 00:16:07.770
He wouldn't fight.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.800
Honest? Then why would he be taken
to the police station?

00:16:10.848 --> 00:16:12.048
To claim an ID card, is it?

00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:13.329
Don't...

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.969
It's on you.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.010
You pushed him first

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.410
and drove him to fight back.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.490
Aunty,

00:16:18.569 --> 00:16:20.370
fighting back is also assaulting.

00:16:20.448 --> 00:16:21.840
You've admitted the fault for him.

00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:22.689
What did he call me?

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.315
- What did you call me?
- Aunty.

00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:25.130
Aunty.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:25.849
You brat.

00:16:25.849 --> 00:16:26.729
Are you blind?

00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:27.803
You call me aunty? You!

00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:29.004
You think nobody can control you?

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.250
Today, I'm putting you in your place.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:30.969
Zhixia.

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:31.569
Come on.

00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:32.569
You little rascal.

00:16:33.729 --> 00:16:34.650
I didn't touch you.

00:16:35.969 --> 00:16:36.847
She hit me.

00:16:36.848 --> 00:16:38.050
- I didn't do it.
- Officer.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.609
What happened?

00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:39.250
I didn't hit him.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.960
What are you all making
a fuss about in the station?

00:16:40.969 --> 00:16:43.170
Officer, hear me out.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:43.960
Please hear me out.

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:45.010
My son got beaten up,

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.400
but we won't pursue it anymore.

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:47.370
Really, we won't.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.404
I just want to say something to the boy.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:50.890
I didn't touch him. He fell on his own.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.410
Boy, how about this?

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.929
Let's not drag this out.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.569
Can we settle this privately?

00:16:55.582 --> 00:16:56.448
Settle this privately?

00:16:56.493 --> 00:16:57.170
Yes.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.809
Fine. We'll settle this privately.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.130
Absolutely not.

00:17:01.404 --> 00:17:02.737
That'd be too easy for you.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.400
I'm going to put you
in your place today.

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:06.730
Zhixia. I accept a private settlement.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.329
He fell again.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.210
I accept a private settlement.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.690
I didn't hit him.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.329
You did.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.569
I wasn't totally right either.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.159
I admitted fault to the officer,
and we apologized to each other.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.360
Settle it privately and go home.

00:17:14.404 --> 00:17:15.160
Xu Zhidong,

00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:17.530
you got bullied by a high-schooler,

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.730
and you apologize?

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.649
You're such a coward.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.730
What's it? Your eyes?

00:17:22.893 --> 00:17:24.080
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:24.849
Were you hit?

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.409
Minghui.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:28.970
Mingzhu!

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.730
Careful.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.690
Minghui!

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.649
Mingzhu,

00:17:34.826 --> 00:17:35.600
why did you come?

00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:36.490
Are you okay?

00:17:36.649 --> 00:17:37.329
I'm fine.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.649
How did it get this bad?

00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:40.129
Mom, it's Shen Mingzhu.

00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:40.970
Who?

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.770
Shen Mingzhu.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.290
Zhilu.

00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:47.770
Miss Shen.

00:17:50.849 --> 00:17:51.730
You betrayed me.

00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:53.290
Mrs. Zhang.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.409
What a coincidence.

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:56.569
Well?

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:58.250
My brother.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.089
And he?

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.329
My brother.

00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:04.250
So you all know each other?

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.530
How do you know each other?

00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:07.320
This isn't the place for chit-chat.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:08.569
Alright.

00:18:08.626 --> 00:18:10.226
Both of them are willing to mediate.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.889
Madams,

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.329
if both families have no objection,

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.530
sign the paper later,

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.369
and you can go home.

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:16.569
Is that okay, Mrs. Zhang?

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.450
Sure.

00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:19.849
Alright. One second.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.530
Wait.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.010
Wait.

00:18:29.129 --> 00:18:29.809
- Mom.
- Mom.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:30.569
Hold on, girl.

00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:31.169
Mom.

00:18:31.409 --> 00:18:32.329
Wait a minute.

00:18:33.448 --> 00:18:34.530
What are you trying to do?

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:35.690
Girl.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.089
Are you adopted?

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:44.690
I... I'm Yu Jingxiang.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.329
I'm your biological mother.

00:18:48.848 --> 00:18:50.930
Who are you? What nonsense
are you talking about?

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.690
No, I...

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.329
Enough, Mom.

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:54.089
Miss Shen.

00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:54.890
Don't talk about it now.

00:18:54.893 --> 00:18:55.640
Here's the thing.

00:18:56.089 --> 00:18:57.010
Our family

00:18:57.649 --> 00:18:59.169
once gave away a baby girl.

00:18:59.182 --> 00:19:01.582
Recently, my parents
have been desperately searching for her,

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:02.915
and the leads brought us to you.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.079
The time and place

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.182
when my grandma gave her away
match your situation.

00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:07.089
So...

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:08.970
Zhidong.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:09.730
ID card.

00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:10.409
Right.

00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:11.050
He could be

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.329
your twin brother.

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:13.770
Yes.

00:19:13.889 --> 00:19:14.930
Look at the ID card.

00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:16.329
Look at the birthdate.

00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:18.450
You two were born on the same day.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.010
Right?

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.809
Look.

00:19:24.089 --> 00:19:24.809
Miss Shen,

00:19:25.649 --> 00:19:26.409
if you

00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:28.050
don't believe us,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.690
we can

00:19:30.089 --> 00:19:31.409
do a paternity test.

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:32.809
Paternity test?

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.329
Yes. It's easy now.

00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:37.329
Hair, a toothbrush,

00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:38.450
saliva, or anything will do.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.569
The piano lessons

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.409
and the turnip cabbage.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.569
You approached me on purpose,
didn't you?

00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:46.169
So you've been acting this whole time?

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.709
You're trying to take my sister away

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:48.560
with such low tricks.

00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:49.409
You're despicable.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.050
You're shameless. Don't come near.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.250
Don't touch my sister.

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:53.050
What are you doing?

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:53.970
What are you trying to do?

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.293
Shen Mingzhu! Stay back, Mingzhu!

00:19:55.293 --> 00:19:56.320
You haven't beaten enough?

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.048
Huh?

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.560
- Stop fighting.
- Let's talk nicely.

00:19:58.569 --> 00:19:59.770
Stop, Minghui.

00:19:59.826 --> 00:20:00.970
You think I'm afraid of you?

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:01.930
Minghui, stop it.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:02.840
We can talk peacefully.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.050
Don't you dare touch my sister!

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.809
No means no.

00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:05.809
- Shen Minghui!
- Stop it.

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:06.569
Mom,

00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:07.160
let them fight.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.630
If you weren't Shen Mingzhu's brother,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.520
I'd beat you to death.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:10.379
You want a fight?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.890
Whoever starts the fight
is in the wrong.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.804
When the Shen family begs us
for reconciliation,

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.493
that'll be the chance
to get close to her.

00:20:15.493 --> 00:20:16.730
Shen Minghui, use your brain.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.569
If you throw that punch, you might lose

00:20:18.569 --> 00:20:20.290
your sister.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.290
Think carefully.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:21.930
You can hit me,

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.271
but you can't touch my sister.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.889
- My pitiful son.
- Understood?

00:20:25.137 --> 00:20:25.880
It's tough for you.

00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:26.450
Go.

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:31.649
I'm sorry.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:34.080
What happened just now was on me.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.010
Please forgive me.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.409
I apologize.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.050
An apology is an apology.

00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:42.450
But Mingzhu is still my sister.

00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:46.450
Wait, girl.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:47.169
Mom.

00:20:47.169 --> 00:20:48.089
Zhilu.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.290
Let me just say one more.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.639
Please.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.160
Don't say it.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.530
Just one sentence. I'll just say one.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.871
You don't need to say anything.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.290
I don't know you.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.730
My name is Shen Mingzhu.

00:21:00.889 --> 00:21:01.730
Careful, madam.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.609
Zhilu.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.250
Girl!

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:06.409
Mom.

00:21:06.649 --> 00:21:07.809
Mom.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.050
Mom, look at this.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.569
What is this?

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:11.930
Zhilu's hair.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.770
I don't want hair.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.250
I want my child.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.530
Paternity test.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.930
What exactly did Zhilu say?

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.329
She said,

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.329
she doesn't know me.

00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:41.010
Before today,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.290
she really didn't know us.

00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:48.569
But after today, she does.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.770
And she knows them too.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.290
Dad,

00:21:54.315 --> 00:21:56.050
it's not that she doesn't recognize us.

00:21:56.809 --> 00:21:57.649
She just refuses to.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.250
What kind of talk is that?

00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:04.290
We're her real parents,

00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:08.089
and blood is always thicker than water.

00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:11.409
How did that child end up being raised

00:22:11.409 --> 00:22:13.530
to be so cold and ungrateful?

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:15.770
Dad,

00:22:15.915 --> 00:22:17.490
why should our Xu family's daughter

00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:19.809
be raised by someone else?

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.809
Who should we ask?

00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:25.089
Ask that old Madam Yu.

00:22:25.809 --> 00:22:27.050
Ask her yourself.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.089
Listen to me,

00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:30.409
this year,

00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:33.050
I'll let it go.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.210
But if anyone
visits her grave next year,

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.770
I...

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:38.490
I'll go.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.089
What will you do?

00:22:41.609 --> 00:22:43.290
I'll break your legs.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.010
Go on then.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.290
Come on, hit me.

00:22:45.809 --> 00:22:47.490
If you don't, you're not yourself.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.329
I'm warning you,

00:22:48.329 --> 00:22:49.210
if you break me,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.293
I'll be in a wheelchair,
and you'll be in prison.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.329
I'm not afraid of prison.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:54.930
I'm warning you,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.770
Yu family,

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.290
don't push me.

00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:59.089
I...

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:04.649
I provoked you.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.930
What now?

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:06.770
What are you doing?

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.120
What are you doing?

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.293
Tell me, what are you doing?

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:10.530
Let's separate.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.889
If you touch me...

00:23:11.889 --> 00:23:12.930
I'll touch you.

00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:14.770
You really did.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:15.450
Yes.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.409
Do it again.

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:17.730
Fine!

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.290
You...

00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:21.010
Our life now

00:23:21.329 --> 00:23:23.210
is either graves or police visits.

00:23:23.315 --> 00:23:25.426
No wonder Shen Mingzhu
won't recognize you.

00:23:25.889 --> 00:23:27.050
Even I don't want to.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:32.889
Let's eat first.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:42.530
Minghui.

00:23:42.826 --> 00:23:43.880
What's wrong, Mingzhu?

00:23:46.226 --> 00:23:47.530
About what happened today,

00:23:48.115 --> 00:23:49.490
don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.369
I already told them.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.809
What did you say?

00:23:54.129 --> 00:23:55.730
I... I just told the truth.

00:23:56.409 --> 00:23:57.803
That family is very cunning.

00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:59.560
They've had their eye on us
for a long time.

00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:02.169
Why do you blurt things out so fast?

00:24:02.889 --> 00:24:04.250
It's already been said.

00:24:04.448 --> 00:24:06.426
Mom and Dad
will find out sooner or later.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.970
Go on, do your homework.

00:24:37.129 --> 00:24:38.690
What's the matter, tossing and turning?

00:24:39.889 --> 00:24:40.690
Can't sleep?

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:41.730
Just that...

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.770
Minghui said that family

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.569
has been watching us for ages.

00:24:50.129 --> 00:24:51.050
When did he say that?

00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:53.329
He said it today.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.490
What are you thinking?

00:24:56.182 --> 00:24:58.010
They've had their eye
on us for a long time.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.450
At the time,

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:15.530
I didn't have a strong impression.

00:25:16.649 --> 00:25:17.569
That old lady

00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:19.010
gave the child to us to raise.

00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:23.799
Did she give us an address?

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.004
A phone number or anything?

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.970
There was no address and no phone.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.409
Nothing at all.

00:25:33.129 --> 00:25:34.970
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.409
I'm just puzzled.

00:25:37.809 --> 00:25:38.970
You said there was nothing.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.169
No one looked for us all these years.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.609
How did they suddenly find our doorstep?

00:25:46.089 --> 00:25:47.290
And find it so precisely.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.089
This is strange.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.809
Yeah, I'm puzzled too.

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:51.970
Aren't you puzzled as well?

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:53.849
I'm so thirsty. Give me...

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.770
It's so stuffy. Get me some water.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.409
No, it's too cold.

00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:58.369
Make it warm, please.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.089
Wait.

00:26:02.649 --> 00:26:03.490
Get some medicine?

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.319
No medicine. Just add hot water.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.937
Go downstairs and fetch some hot water.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.160
(No. 68 Wen Zhong Avenue, Xidi Road,
Gucheng District, Nanzhou City.)

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.515
(26 March, 1994)

00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:02.010
Dinner's ready!

00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:04.329
We've got big drumsticks tonight.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.490
One for Mingzhu, and one for Minghui.

00:27:07.849 --> 00:27:09.210
Mingzhu gets the bigger one.

00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:10.889
Look at our boy.

00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:12.609
He's cared for his sister at this age.

00:27:12.609 --> 00:27:13.450
Good lad.

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.930
Here, Mingzhu.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.290
Careful, it's hot. Eat up.

00:27:19.409 --> 00:27:20.050
Mom.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.450
I'm not your real daughter, am I?

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.450
We had a health check at school.

00:27:30.809 --> 00:27:31.970
My blood type is B,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.450
but the book says two people
with type A blood

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.490
can't have a child with type B blood.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.329
Then how do you know

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.050
your mom and I both have type A?

00:27:44.569 --> 00:27:46.450
I heard it when you two

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.089
donated blood last time.

00:27:54.089 --> 00:27:54.770
Don't hide it.

00:27:56.089 --> 00:27:56.889
It's pointless now.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:03.690
Mingzhu.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:05.930
Years ago,

00:28:06.782 --> 00:28:09.026
your mom and I
went to the countryside for vegetables.

00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:11.849
A family there had twins.

00:28:12.648 --> 00:28:13.871
They couldn't raise both,

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.129
so they gave you to us.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.609
At that time,

00:28:19.609 --> 00:28:22.050
you were just this tiny.

00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:24.730
We brought you home,

00:28:25.889 --> 00:28:27.609
and raised you like our own.

00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:34.970
Mingzhu,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.649
you were fed with my milk,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.369
and raised by us.

00:28:41.849 --> 00:28:43.210
You're our daughter.

00:28:43.569 --> 00:28:44.250
Mingzhu,

00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:47.690
you'll understand when you grow up,

00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:51.448
that being raised
counts more than being born.

00:28:53.609 --> 00:28:55.530
I don't need to grow up to know that.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.809
This is my home.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.530
You're my mom and dad.

00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.849
Mingzhu.

00:29:06.129 --> 00:29:07.590
Mingzhu, eat more.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.490
Have some vegetables.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.649
Eat more rice too.

00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:11.450
Mingzhu, eat more.

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:13.169
- Yes.
- Eat more, Mingzhu.

00:29:13.409 --> 00:29:14.450
You too, Minghui.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.730
Eat more, both of you.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:25.730
Hello, Ni.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.809
(Ni Makeup Studio)
Mingzhu, are you asleep?

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.889
Not yet.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:30.770
I knew it.

00:29:30.782 --> 00:29:32.100
Come out for a late-night snack.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.889
Now?

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.690
I'm pregnant.

00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:36.409
Pregnant women can't eat supper?

00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:37.730
Which doctor said that?

00:29:41.182 --> 00:29:42.880
I was looking
through my photo album today.

00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:44.809
From my first birthday till now,

00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:46.690
there's a photo for every year.

00:29:47.169 --> 00:29:49.490
From three people to four in the family.

00:29:50.329 --> 00:29:51.569
Last year, with Jianqi,

00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:53.490
we became a family of five.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.210
Then, Jianqi passed away.

00:29:58.169 --> 00:30:00.450
My birth parents suddenly showed up.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.690
And you even have siblings.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.290
The two brothers fought today.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.290
Life's joys and sorrows

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.690
all hit me at once.

00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:10.290
Just this past month,

00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:11.970
I've felt it all.

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:17.369
Excuse me. Two tea eggs, please.

00:30:17.369 --> 00:30:18.010
Got it.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.290
Eat something.

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:25.930
Tea eggs, here.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.210
Thanks.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.649
Listen, life's ups and downs
don't fill your stomach.

00:30:35.609 --> 00:30:36.530
Ni, tell me.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.490
If my birth parents
insist on taking me back,

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:40.569
what should I do?

00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:42.210
If they're rich, just go with it.

00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:43.530
Why refuse free money?

00:30:46.089 --> 00:30:47.649
If only Jianqi were here.

00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:49.450
He'd help me figure it all out.

00:30:50.129 --> 00:30:50.930
I know.

00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:52.770
Jianqi's gone.

00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:54.609
It's just me now.

00:30:55.649 --> 00:30:56.329
And you.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:02.889
Mother.

00:31:06.089 --> 00:31:07.690
Since you've blessed us,

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.730
and let Xiang and me

00:31:10.409 --> 00:31:12.329
find our second daughter Zhilu,

00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:16.129
please keep helping us.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.849
Grant her some guidance,

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.010
so she'll be willing to recognize us.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.770
Please, Mother.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.089
Dear Mother.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.569
I beg you.

00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:33.649
I beg you.

00:31:34.609 --> 00:31:35.210
Mother.

00:31:36.089 --> 00:31:37.530
Let me bow to you.

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:02.569
Miss.

00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:05.089
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:07.129
Where's Shen Family Restaurant?

00:32:07.129 --> 00:32:08.569
It's right here.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:10.930
This one?

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.050
Okay. Thank you.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:12.530
No problem.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.329
Alright, thanks.

00:32:13.329 --> 00:32:14.089
Goodbye.

00:32:14.089 --> 00:32:14.649
Bye.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.129
This one tastes...

00:33:09.129 --> 00:33:09.690
Better?

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.490
Not as sweet.

00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.889
What's wrong?

00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:13.290
Mom.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:13.849
What is it?

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.849
That woman.

00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.730
Who?

00:33:15.804 --> 00:33:17.210
The one from the police station.

00:33:17.226 --> 00:33:18.960
The one who said she's my sister's mom.

00:33:22.293 --> 00:33:23.530
I'll go tell her to leave.

00:33:23.649 --> 00:33:24.809
Don't. Wait.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.050
You go inside first.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.450
You sure about that?

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:29.770
Go, go on.

00:33:59.169 --> 00:33:59.970
- Sorry.
-You...

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.530
Sorry, madam. I splashed you.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.730
What are you doing?

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.071
What's wrong with your family?

00:34:06.115 --> 00:34:06.730
Lost something?

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.515
Why stand at our door
looking so miserable?

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:09.647
We're running a business.

00:34:09.648 --> 00:34:10.680
Don't bring bad luck here.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:11.769
Mom, the meal is ready.

00:34:12.209 --> 00:34:12.810
Let's go.

00:34:13.249 --> 00:34:14.769
There are too many people around.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.289
Don't come again, alright?

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:16.970
It's not safe.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.026
Come on, let's eat.

00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:20.490
Go home now.

00:34:23.249 --> 00:34:23.850
Let's go.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.729
I don't know you.

00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:40.410
My name is Shen Mingzhu.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.129
The fingers brushed the water
like ripples on a lake.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.129
Look at this.

00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:24.050
Jiao's been working so hard.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.050
Jiao.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.240
Dad's calling you for breakfast again.

00:35:28.649 --> 00:35:29.530
Coming.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.249
That's the magic of praise.

00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:36.010
Ever since Mingzhu
tutored her last time,

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.010
look at our Jiao now.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.330
She's doing great.

00:35:38.609 --> 00:35:39.649
Alright, enough.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.490
Every time I think about

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.649
those long-lost siblings,

00:35:42.649 --> 00:35:43.890
my head hurts.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.410
Then we won't mention them.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.649
They're grown-ups anyway.

00:35:47.249 --> 00:35:49.530
Here, have your egg sunny-side up.

00:35:54.129 --> 00:35:54.890
What's wrong?

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:55.649
Mom, what's wrong?

00:35:56.289 --> 00:35:57.169
Wipe it off.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.649
You okay?

00:36:00.249 --> 00:36:01.450
Pregnancy looks so hard.

00:36:02.209 --> 00:36:03.530
Maybe you shouldn't have the baby.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.569
I know Mom's been struggling.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.089
So we should cheer her up more.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:13.129
Alright?

00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:13.970
I'm fine.

00:36:14.649 --> 00:36:15.649
Let's eat.

00:36:15.649 --> 00:36:16.490
Breakfast time.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:17.850
What's happening?

00:36:18.569 --> 00:36:20.370
It's been almost two months, right?

00:36:20.649 --> 00:36:21.890
Why does it seem worse

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:22.890
than when you had Jiao?

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.010
You don't understand.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.370
At two months,
every smell feels stronger.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.010
You really should read this app.

00:36:32.209 --> 00:36:34.249
Then you'll know
how hard it is for women.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.010
Nine weeks in.

00:36:36.769 --> 00:36:38.609
The baby's about the size of a cherry.

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:40.010
Arms and legs are growing fast.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.089
Such a tiny thing,

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.930
and already giving you trouble.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.169
You need to behave, little one.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.129
Don't bully Mom.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.010
That's right. Or I'll scold you.

00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:51.129
Go on, give a smack.

00:36:51.129 --> 00:36:52.089
A gentle one.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.330
Just a warning this time.

00:36:55.289 --> 00:36:57.010
This app is actually quite professional.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.450
I should study it more.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.370
From now on,

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.026
your only job
is to eat, rest, and relax.

00:37:02.048 --> 00:37:02.760
Just lie back.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.890
Everything else...

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:04.890
Coming!

00:37:06.649 --> 00:37:07.649
Is that my delivery?

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.249
Mom's here.

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:15.569
Come in, Mom. Come.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:16.930
Mom.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:18.370
What brings you here?

00:37:19.649 --> 00:37:21.330
Mom, why didn't you change your shoes?

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.569
What's wrong, Grandma?

00:37:24.729 --> 00:37:26.569
Mom, your shoes are soaked.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.609
You stepped in a puddle?

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.450
Mom, did you catch a chill?

00:37:44.649 --> 00:37:45.569
Have some medicine.

00:37:47.689 --> 00:37:48.569
Just put it down.

00:37:48.609 --> 00:37:50.129
Take Jiao to school first.

00:37:50.609 --> 00:37:51.970
She's stuck in the bathroom again.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.370
You know what your daughter's like.

00:37:54.129 --> 00:37:56.330
Jiao, hurry up. You'll be late.

00:37:57.209 --> 00:37:59.010
Okay, I'm coming.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.410
Mom's shivering again.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.639
Get her some socks.
There are new ones in the drawer.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.915
- Go on, quick.
- Okay.

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:10.050
Here, Mom.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.050
It's done.

00:38:12.609 --> 00:38:13.249
Mom.

00:38:14.129 --> 00:38:15.490
What's wrong, really?

00:38:16.769 --> 00:38:18.010
Don't scare me.

00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:21.450
My real daughter

00:38:22.769 --> 00:38:23.810
refuses to recognize me.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.769
That fake mother

00:38:29.129 --> 00:38:31.010
threw dirty water at me.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:32.569
Mom.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.609
Mom...

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.450
Mom, it's alright.

00:38:39.129 --> 00:38:39.890
You're okay, Mom.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.010
Mom.

00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:47.729
It's alright.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.850
So your younger daughter
wouldn't accept you,

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.569
and that made you anxious, right?

00:38:57.129 --> 00:38:59.010
Because she wouldn't acknowledge you,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.810
you often feel uneasy, correct?

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:03.089
Yes.

00:39:04.129 --> 00:39:06.010
How about your sleep lately?

00:39:06.093 --> 00:39:07.080
- Not good.
- Not good.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.890
I keep having bad dreams all the time.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:13.810
And your appetite? Eating well?

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.115
- Not really.
- Not really.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.530
Nothing tastes good anymore.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.609
Sir, my mom...

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.330
She's alright. Not bad.

00:39:24.337 --> 00:39:25.530
Overall, she's in good shape.

00:39:30.649 --> 00:39:31.649
Mom, sit for a bit.

00:39:34.569 --> 00:39:35.410
Listen,

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.810
your mother's condition

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.810
is moderate anxiety with depression.

00:39:39.249 --> 00:39:40.930
It needs early control and treatment.

00:39:59.129 --> 00:39:59.729
Zhixia.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.050
Mom.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.129
What happened?

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:09.569
She's depressed.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:11.850
Truly depressed?

00:40:12.249 --> 00:40:12.890
Where's Dad?

00:40:16.569 --> 00:40:17.930
Probably not far off either.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.289
Keep an eye on them.

00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:35.370
I'll come when I can.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:35.930
Alright.

00:40:36.729 --> 00:40:37.609
About the medicine,

00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:39.129
can Dad take it too?

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.089
You take it instead.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.569
My birthday's coming.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.569
I've planned it all.

00:40:52.129 --> 00:40:54.129
I'll treat everyone to seafood.

00:40:54.569 --> 00:40:55.450
Really, Mingzhu?

00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:56.249
Really.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:58.769
What?

00:40:58.769 --> 00:41:00.129
Seafood costs a lot.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.370
Buy it home and let your dad cook.

00:41:02.689 --> 00:41:04.129
Come on, Mom, don't be so tight.

00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:05.289
Exactly.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.129
Dad's cooked all his life.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.010
He should go out and enjoy himself.

00:41:09.089 --> 00:41:09.769
That's right.

00:41:10.129 --> 00:41:11.010
We're in catering.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.330
We ought to get out more.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.490
You should learn and compare.

00:41:15.649 --> 00:41:16.609
He's right.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:17.970
It's her birthday.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.010
She gets to decide.

00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:21.530
We'll go out and try places.

00:41:22.289 --> 00:41:22.890
Good.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.530
As long as our girl is happy.

00:41:24.769 --> 00:41:25.649
Let's go then.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.930
The weather's nice today.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.689
I'll take you for a walk later.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.450
No need, Mom.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.010
I want to cancel
the wedding photos today.

00:41:38.209 --> 00:41:39.330
I'll go cancel them, Mingzhu.

00:41:39.569 --> 00:41:41.169
You're the bride, aren't you?

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.490
You stay home and do your homework.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.370
I'm heading out then.

00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:48.490
Be careful, Mingzhu.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.569
Come back early.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:53.569
Okay.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.169
Those people won't
keep tailing Mingzhu, will they?

00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:03.450
Get me some more rice.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.569
I'll follow her. Eat slowly.

00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:10.890
Sit down.

00:42:11.289 --> 00:42:12.810
You can't follow her for life.

00:42:13.769 --> 00:42:14.649
Just sit here and eat.

00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:16.609
What else can she do?

00:42:17.129 --> 00:42:17.930
Well...

00:42:19.089 --> 00:42:20.089
Take it step by step.

00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:41.569
