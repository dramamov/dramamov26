[Freshman Orientation Day]

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.520
What an ugly nail job!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.800
Gosh, you're so whiny.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.480
- Why don't you go to a nail salon instead?
- They...

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.140
Hey!

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.760
I have to...

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.400
- Hey! Don't push!
- My nails must dry first.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.760
Blow them dry for me.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.600
Come on. That won't make them dry.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.320
You've still got newspapers?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.040
How old school!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.640
Oh, they're Dad's old newspapers.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
We didn't know where to put them,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.920
so we put them here for now.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.680
Whoa, do you guys remember this headline?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Hey, I do!

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.600
It was a huge one.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.280
A girl sneaked into a school
and stole a computer.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.240
- Then she stabbed a teacher to death.
- Oh...

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.760
She then waited for the cops
to show up and arrest her.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.240
That's scary.

Yeah, that's the one.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.800
- Beautiful!
- Did you take a photo?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.550
I did!

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.280
Oh, I have to remove the nail polish.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960
Gotta feed my dad,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I don't want any polish in his food.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040
Okay.

Hey, Bell.

19-Stab Claire is going to
remove the nail polish for you!

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.500
Bye, Dad.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.480
We're leaving now.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.640
It's okay, Auay.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.680

"Rapin takes a slow, deep breath.

He grabs the torch,

holding it against the rifle's handguard.

Why did you stop?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.140
I was on the edge of my seat.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.440
We'll be back after a quick break.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.400
Rapin Praiwan must have his meal first!

My academic gown is here.

After the meal,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.600
how about I get changed,
and we take a photo together?

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360
Dad!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.400
Your beautiful daughter is here.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.080
Excuse me, dad.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.280
It's okay.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.120
You look amazing today.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.640
How are you already in the backyard?

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440
Ready?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.920
One more?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.520
10 more, please.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.440
Can you do 10 more photos?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.520
I can.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.280
Congratulations.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.640
You didn't have to give me this.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.320
Don't be so considerate.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.240
It's just a necklace, not that expensive.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.760
With you paying my tuition,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.600
I don't know how I'll be able to repay you,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.200
Here. Let me put it on for you.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.360
Hey, Top!

Hi.

This is Dream.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.880
This is Bell,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.240
- Top's girlfriend.
- She's my girlfriend.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.560
Just sit down already.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.120
Alright! Drink up!

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.400
To Bell!

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.640
Congratulations!

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.360
Hand me your shot glass
if you want some more!

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.560
Alright, alright!

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
What do you think of my friends?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.680
They're good company.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.960
Do you like them?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.000
Hey, guys!

Let's go!

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.280
- Top, you go and dance.
- Please.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.560
Come and dance with me. Just once.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600
Let's go!

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.800
- Come on.
- I'm bad at dancing.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.600
Quick!

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040
It's just for fun.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.800
Come on.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.440
Hey, bro!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.560
Top!

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.880
You're completely hammered.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.520
The car key...

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.960
Leave it with me for now.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.720
I'm going to the bathroom, okay?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.560
Mm.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.920
Do you want me to come with you?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.960
It's fine.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.320
Just dance and be with your friends.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.240
- I can go there by myself.
- Okay.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.760
Hello?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240
Hi, Dad.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.800
Where are you?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840
Your voice sounds so echoey.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.340
I'm at a nightclub.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.240
Top took me to a graduation party.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.760
Mm. Don't be late, okay?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.600
I'll be home soon.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.000
Don't worry, Dad.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
I love you, Dad.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.030
Mm.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.840
I love you, too, dear.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.040
Beam!

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.280
Where's Top?

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.840
I'll be right back, okay?

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.160
Beam, where's Top?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.320
I'll be back.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.200
Hello, Bell.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.000
Where are you?

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.640
Someone called the cops on the nightclub.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.280
We're all outside.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.120
You should...

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.440
Meet me at my car.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.760
Leave as quickly as you can!

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.520
Where's my car key?!

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.240
The car key's with me.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.280
Top! Hurry!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.400
My arms are killing me!

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.520
Come on!

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.480
This way!

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.360
Top?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.360
My bag is full of drugs.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.480
- Huh?!
- Ow!

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.040
How?!

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.920
I don't know.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.200
What do I do?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.880
Someone must have slipped them in

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.400
when you went to the bathroom.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.680
What do you want me to do?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.840
Should I give them to the cops?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.000
Hold on, Bell.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.080
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.720
What am I supposed to do?!

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.280
Pull yourself together.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.520
Let me think for a second.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.400
Top!

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.360
Hold up.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.040
Give me a second.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.880
I'm back!

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920
Watch me.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.960
Let's go, dude!

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.240
Here's the plan.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.880
Throw them away.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.120
They're in your handbag.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.640
If you don't throw them away,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.200
you'll be in big trouble
if the cops find out.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.960
How would you explain yourself?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.040
Hey, miss.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.040
What are you doing?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.800
Sergeant,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.040
- search everything.
- Yes, sir!

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.520
Lieutenant...

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.080
They're not mine.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.400
Whose are they then?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.960
They're not mine.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.560
Someone stuffed them in my handbag.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.040
They're actually not mine.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.800
How's that possible, huh?

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.040
You're the only person here.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.200
How could they not be yours?!

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.560
They're not mine.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.360
- Sergeant, arrest her.
- Top!

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.000
Top! Help me!

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.240
Top!

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.200
Bell!

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.320
- Bell!
- Top, come here!

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.560
- Hands off!
- Damn it, Top!

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.960
- Top!
- Come here!

00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.840
Hands behind your back.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.800
Top!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.160
- Please listen to me!
- Hands behind your back.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.480
- Top!
- Top, listen to me.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.760
Calm down.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.880
Stand still.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.920
Top!

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.440
Move it!

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.280
What are you waiting for?

the warden of this prison.

If you want to live comfortably,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.080
obey the rules.

00:15:48.446 --> 00:15:50.446
And the prison director

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.440
will leave you alone.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.400
If there's anything

you can always talk to the female guards.

I want you to remember that

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.920
being imprisoned is meant

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.680
to make you feel the weight of your actions.

Kinda rhymes with jail, doesn't it?

Jail?

Possession of drugs.

Possession of drugs?

I have this medicine,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.680
so you think I'm a drug addict

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.560
or a dealer, right?

No, it's not like that.

We've got jobs to do here, by the way.

The harder you work,
the more you'll get paid.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.680
The less you do, the less you'll get paid.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.440
The earnings you receive

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.200
can be either credits you spend here

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.680
or actual payment once you're free.

This is just a bottle of antihistamines.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.120
I have a dust allergy,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.400

I also have to take the same medicine.

I have a shellfish allergy.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.520
Oh, what a coincidence.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.160
So we're both just as weak.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.800
Actually...

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.920
Two years isn't that long.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.600
If you know how to make friends and be social,

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.720
this place isn't as bad as you think.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.120
It's Pa'Porn's greenhouse.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.240
Who is she?

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.480
She's just a kind-hearted elderly inmate.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.280
She loves gardening and tending to the plants.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.720
That's why she often comes to the greenhouse.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.160
What plants has she got there?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.720

Aside from Pa'Porn,

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.080
no one else dares to enter the greenhouse.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640
It's too dangerous.

Who are the 3Ds?

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.440
There.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160
That's Dao.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.120
Aside from being everyone's boss,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.640
she's also the biggest sister of the 3Ds gang.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.960
And the girl eating next to her?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.240
That's Duen,

Dao's younger sister.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.560
She always does the boss's bidding.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.760
And the last D there,

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.840
she's a fierce one.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.440
That tough-looking girl is

- Yes.

she's a troublemaker.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.480
She loves getting into fights with others.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.560
If you were to run into them,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.400
be careful, okay?

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.280
And...

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.240
What's the origin behind the name?

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.320
Dao, Duen, and Deedee.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.480
That's three names
starting with letter D, so it's 3Ds.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.560
- Oi, Karakade?
- Yes?

00:23:22.593 --> 00:23:23.593
Where's the eyebrow pencil?

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.640
- Oh...
- From Mangpor. Is it here?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.920
The new batch has arrived.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.600
Always buying nothing but bits and pieces.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.680
It's stuff for the beautiful.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.040
You'll never get it, Dao.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.280
What were you laughing at?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.440
Well...

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.000
Deedee called you ugly.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.640
I already knew that.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.280
I got dumber because
you kept slapping my head.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.640
You've always been this way.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.000
You wanted to see me, Dao?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.560
Someone told me

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.680
you stole a piece of candy from the shop?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.840
I...

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.920
Pa'Porn always gave me free candies.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.080
I didn't know,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.320
so I thought I could just get one for free.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.120
I'm now in charge of the shop.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160
Not Pa'Porn anymore!

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.280
There are no such things as freebies.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.240
All of you, listen up!

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.080
How many pieces did you take?

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.520
I took three of them,

- I don't accept returns.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.160
That's one.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.200
That's two.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.240
Stop.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.560
You may go now.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.840

It's the new inmate.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.400
She's Kae's cellmate.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.880
I bet she wants to claim the new kid.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.240
Thank you.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.000
What do you have in mind?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.000
Back then, it was Pa'Porn
who was in charge of this shop.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.200
She was so generous.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.560
She'd give candies as freebies.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.990
Apparently, she was too kind.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.560
She gave away too many freebies,
so sales went down.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.280
Once Wichai found out,

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.520
she got chewed out
and transferred to another job.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.280
Since then,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.720
Wichai assigned the 3Ds to the shop.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.600
Seeing a shop in a prison

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200
is kind of weird, isn't it?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.760
You can actually find almost anything here,
just like outside.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
There are only two things
that you can't find here.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.960
What are they?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.120
Freedom and happiness.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.920
That didn't sound cool, did it?

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.280
It did.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.200
Treating yourself to some tasty treats

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.840
is a simple joy for the inmates.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.640
It's just a shame that

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.960
the money doesn't go to the prison,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.700
or else the quality of life
would have improved.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.520
Then where does the money go?

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.560
You were once stationed at a detention center.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880

When I was working there...

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.840
The youths were just as bad as the adults.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.360
Some were even worse.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.760
They needed discipline

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.440
and punishment so that they'd remember.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.960
However, the authorities
didn't have much power

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.520
due to one reason:

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.320
they were just kids.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.040
Ultimately, they'd get set free

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.320
only to grow up and become
full-grown prisoners.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.200

The director hasn't even approved the request.

If I submitted another one,

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.240
it'd look suspicious.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.920
They're still alive.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.680
Give them some water, fertilizer,

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.880
and a little bit of sunlight,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.920
and they'll do just fine.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.560
They're useless and produce nothing.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.200
Why waste time planting them?

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.620
I think...

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.120
Once they sprout the flowers...

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.120
Everyone here will get to see

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.120
- something beautiful.
- Gosh.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.160
The leaves are all brown.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200
How are they beautiful?

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240
Get rid of them already.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.480
Are you new here, love?

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840
Why do you care?

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.280
You're messing with me?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.480
I'm not, love.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.720
But the one who planted the roses

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.320
put a lot of effort into them.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.880
She really doesn't want them to wither away.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.920
Please give them a chance.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.080
Plus, at least...

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.440
Let them actually die first
before getting rid of them.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.280
Make sure the rest of the roses are gone, too.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.480
Plant something like vegetables instead.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.560
Planting roses? How pretentious.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.960
What an eyesore.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.600
Calm down, Claire.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.640
It's okay, dear.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.060
It's you,

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.480
the one planting the roses?

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.040
Perfect.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.040
They're all dying. Get rid of them.

Obeying instructions

It's okay.

Better let him have a rest.

If you love each other that much,

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.120
I'll let the stars decide

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.440
which one will survive,

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.960
and which one will be punished.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.760
Aw, sis...

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:28.120
♫The Mon hides the cloth,
the doll's behind you♫

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:34.280
♫Put it here, and put it there,
and I'll smack your bottom♫

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.160
Oh? You're the lucky one,

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.800
new inmate.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.280
I've been waiting for this.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.120
- Hey!
- Out of the way!

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.240
Move!

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.120
Where are you going?

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.640
Bell! Bell!

00:54:01.953 --> 00:54:03.673
Where are you going, girl?

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.240
Move.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.640
There's my diva!

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.800
Go, queen!

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.440
Come on!

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Peekaboo!

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.760
Aw, what should we do?

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.800
Want to have some fun, girl?

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:39.120
Where are you going, girl?

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.840
This has nothing to do with you.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880
Move.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.760
Why should I?

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.120
I haven't eaten.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.080
Let's go.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.080
Dao told us not to mess with her.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.840
Fine.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.520
I'll postpone our little game.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.520
Eat with me.

00:56:46.686 --> 00:56:47.680
I've got too much.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.320
Can't finish it all.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.600
It'd be a waste.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200
That's okay.

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.360
I can get a tray myself.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.640
Disgusted?

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.240
No, not at all.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.760
I'm sorry.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.200
I just don't wanna bother you.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.120
It's alright.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.280
Join me.

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.480
Why get another tray?

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.160
I'm sorry.

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.520
How many times are you gonna apologize?

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.840
I'm waiting.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.520
I'm sorry.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.560
Wait, no.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.960
I'll stop.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.320
Do you like egg yolk?

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.480
If you don't, pass it to me.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.040
I don't, actually.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.040
Deedee.

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880
Excuse me.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.040
Are you the new guard
who had a fight with the Rabid Dog?

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:49.960
What is it?

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.440
Do you want revenge?

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.200
Kae, are you alright?

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.520
I'm fine!

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.080
It's probably the allergy.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.520
I'll get better with the medicine.
