00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.320
Let's eat!

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.040
You made all of this?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.520
Sure did.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.860
Try it and tell me what you think.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.920
It's really good.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.490
My foster mom taught me
how to make the dishes.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.040
I grew up an orphan.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.280
My foster parents took me in.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.400
Eat while it's hot.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.080
So,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.280
were they good to you?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.080
They were kind to me.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.240
They treated me like their own daughter.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.800
Even sent me to school.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400
If it weren't for them,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.560
I never would've become

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.160
Zhou Musheng's junior.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.360
Is it good?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.120
My foster mom used to tell me,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.560
the way to a man's heart

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.080
is through his stomach.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.720
You should work on your cooking a bit.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.600
Come on, don't tease her.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.160
I'll handle the cooking.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.800
Can you even cook?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.040
I'll learn.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.560
It'll be edible.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.840
Definitely edible.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.360
(Xu...)

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.160
(As long as Zhou Musheng
truly cares for you,)

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.960
(I can be at peace.)

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.240
Dad.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.800
This jade pendant is beautiful.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.840
It's our family heirloom.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.400
When you grow up and get married,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.880
I'll pass it down to you, alright?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.680
Alright.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.600
Who bought these pomegranates?

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.200
Man Li brought them.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.200
How does she know I love pomegranates?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.960
She always brings them when she visits.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.520
(My dear Xu,)

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.040
(I wish I could tell you myself)

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.800
(that I'm your sister.)

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.440
(But it's too late now.)

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.440
Oh no!

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.400
(When you open this letter,)

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.280
(I will already be gone.)

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.640
(I won't be able)

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.600
(to buy your favorite
pomegranates anymore)

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160
(or your candied hawthorns.)

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.240
(Luckily, there's Zhou Musheng.)

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.840
(He can take care of you in my place.)

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.080
(I often think back to the little
moments from our childhood.)

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.240
(I miss our father and mother.)

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.880
(I hate Du Hongyue with all my heart.)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.960
(For his own selfish gain,)

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.480
(he killed our father and mother.)

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520
(They died a brutal death.)

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.520
(You and I
were left alone and helpless.)

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.680
(We had nowhere to go.)

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.160
(When I think about it,)

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.800
(I want nothing more
than to crush him to dust.)

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.160
(Don't blame me for leaving you behind.)

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.920
(If there is another life,)

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.120
(I will be your older brother.)

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.720
(You will be my little brother.)

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.440
(I will use every ounce
of strength to protect you.)

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.760
(Take care.)

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.680
(Xu.)

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.400
(Your loving sister,)

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.440
(Zhen Yi.)

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.920
You're awake.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.080
What are you doing?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.680
Let me go.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.760
You'll find out soon enough.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.680
You're crazy.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.680
Let me go now!

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.320
What are you doing?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.680
You've really lost your mind.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.840
Let me go!

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.280
Man Li!

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.440
Man Li!

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.400
I'm not Man Li!

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.400
I'm Zhen Yi.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.880
The daughter of Zhen Huai'an.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.400
How could you be

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.600
the daughter of Zhen Huai'an?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.240
Why not?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.120
Why can't I be
the daughter of Zhen Huai'an?

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.160
Man Li,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.920
you know

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.480
I have my own reasons too.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.720
For the sake of the bond we shared,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.440
please let me go, okay?

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.440
Man Li,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.480
if you let me go now,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.800
I will kneel to your parents
and admit my faults, alright?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.800
I'm sorry!

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.560
Man Li, please forgive me!

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960
Sister!

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.720
Man Li.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.680
Zhenyao. You came
at the right time. Quick.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.190
Give it to me.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.080
Yao.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.040
You're back.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.560
Carry on.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.560
I have work to do.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.960
Hold on.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.760
Come here.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.160
Yao.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.400
Will you do it yourself,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.200
or do you want me to help you?

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.320
I...

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.680
I'll do it myself.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.440
Luo Zhenyao, go to hell.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.680
Yao.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.660
It's a misunderstanding.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.040
A misunderstanding.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.840
Hey, Yao.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.200
Don't...

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.200
It's a misunderstanding.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.560
Yao.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.440
Please.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.080
From this moment on,
the North City Chamber of Commerce

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.000

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.360
It's mine!

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.040
Sister...

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.760
Xu?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.040
Xu!

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.640
Everyone, come out!

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.480
Zhou Musheng.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.120
You betrayed the entire
North City Chamber of Commerce.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.880
Heed my order!

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.520

and capture Zhou Musheng.
