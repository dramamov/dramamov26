Little Yuanyuan

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.960
Next month, Jincheng will host
the Autumn Games.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.640
You'll join me for it then.

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:31.679
Princess

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.840
I have nothing of value.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:35.759
You should find someone else.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:36.880
Young Master Xie

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:38.439
Jincheng's Autumn Games

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.039
have always allowed only women
to compete.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.320
You just need to stay offstage

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.119
and keep the Princess safe.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.000
Alright.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.520
I'll be there.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.399
Go, Princess!

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.200
Young Master Xie

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.240
Let's cheer for the Princess!

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.799
Afu

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.560
Let's begin.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.159
I declare

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.120
the Jincheng Royal Gathering

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.400
is now underway.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:15.959
Go, Princess!

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.920
Both princesses, guess heads or tails.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.840
Heads.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.439
Heads.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.319
Eldest Princess, draw a lot.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.560
This round's contest is

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.280
painting.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.760
Painting.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.480
It's alright.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.239
Though our Princess isn't skilled
at painting,

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.519
we can't lose in spirit

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:49.239
to them.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.599
Right?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.879
That's true.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:51.439
Go for it!

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.159
Go, Princess!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.840
Please announce the results.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.239
This round,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.359
Princess Er wins.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.280
Princess Er

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.879
You won the last round.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.800
You draw lots this round.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.919
Pitch-pot.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.240
Pitch-pot, that's great!

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.439
Pitch-pot.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.199
Pitch-pot is good.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.919
Pitch-pot.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.560
As expected of the Eldest Princess.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.840
Amazing! The Princess is incredible.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.080
Please announce the results.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.680
This round,

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.759
Eldest Princess Su Feng'er wins.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.159
I told you so.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.560
The Princess was bound to win.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.680
Eldest Princess

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.280
You draw lots this round.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.080
This round's contest is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.680
Gomoku.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.560
You lost.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.560
Please announce the results.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.800
This round,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120
Princess Er wins.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240
Princess Er

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:53.719
You draw lots.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.919
Archery.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.120
This round,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.439
Eldest Princess Su Feng'er wins.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.240
Won again!

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.639
The final round decides the winner.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.680
Will it be the martial Eldest Princess

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.120
or the scholarly Princess Er?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.560
It all comes down to this round.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:35.480
Since everyone's so excited,

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.160
then for this last match,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.920
I'll draw the lot myself.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.759
Tug-of-war.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.519
Princess Er has the upper hand now.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:14.439
I think

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.759
she can press on

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.759
and win the contest.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.839
I don't think so.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.079
The Eldest Princess may be brash,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.160
but she always drags it to the final round.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.839
I don't think this match will be easy.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.360
Princess

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.800
What's wrong with the Princess?

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.759
Princess, Princess!

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:42.519
Eunuch

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.079
What's this?

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.120
Reporting to Princess Er,

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.680
this is a tonic from the Lord
for the Eldest Princess.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.959
This old servant will take his leave.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.920
Princess

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.720
Since the Eldest Princess fell ill,

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.519
the Lord has often visited her.

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:13.879
He even sent her many rare tonics.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.560
She really got a windfall.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.839
Discussing the heir

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.120
These ministers seem to have
coordinated their views.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.279
Lord

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.160
You,

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.399
should pay more attention

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.079
to your own health.

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.959
As for appointing the heir,

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:14.040
I have my own plans.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.439
You all jointly petitioned

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.160
for me to appoint an heir.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.000
So,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.439
do you think I won't live long?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.879
Lord

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.680
I did not mean that.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.759
But the nation can't go a day
without an heir.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.519
We fear unforeseen troubles.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.519
Then tell me,

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.519
how should the heir be chosen?

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.519
Reporting to the Lord,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.800
we believe

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.879
the heir should be the eldest
and legitimate.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.759
The Eldest Princess is most suitable.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.920
We believe

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.759
the heir should be virtuous
and capable.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.360
Princess Er is most suitable.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.079
I believe

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.519
the Eldest Princess is most suitable.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.680
Princess Er is suitable.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.959
The Eldest Princess is most suitable.

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:00.319
Princess Er is most suitable.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.279
The Eldest Princess is most suitable.

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.199
Princess Er is most suitable.
