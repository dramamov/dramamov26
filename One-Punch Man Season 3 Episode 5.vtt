00:15.080 --> 00:16.129
Damn it.

00:16.710 --> 00:20.790
<i>What's inside the bandages?</i>
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

00:27.580 --> 00:29.920
If you're caught again,
you're as good as dead.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.630
Old dude...
How did you know I was here?

00:34.330 --> 00:35.920
Because I'm a monster.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.960
This is our chance to
earn some points. Kill 'em!

00:39.080 --> 00:40.670
Hm? I'm pretty sure this guys is...

00:42.040 --> 00:43.290
the Hero Hunter...

00:48.250 --> 00:50.330
I got my revenge.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.540
I've got no other business here,
so I'm outta here.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.750
If you're tagging along,
keep your mouth shut.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.500
W-Wait!

01:01.420 --> 01:04.629
I can't run that fast, old dude.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.580
You're hurt.
Are you okay moving around?

01:07.790 --> 01:10.920
Maybe you should hide
somewhere and rest.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.830
They've figured out our location.

01:13.330 --> 01:15.920
There's a monster with
that kind of power.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.250
If we stand still,
we'll be swarmed by assassins.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.000
But luckily,
they have their hands full

01:23.250 --> 01:25.750
so they're not putting all their effort
into coming after me.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.960
I’ll take out anyone in my way

01:28.040 --> 01:29.880
and exit by the shortest route.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.630
Um...

01:31.710 --> 01:33.880
The thing is...
there's another hostage.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.380
He's about my age!

01:37.500 --> 01:38.540
Who cares?

01:38.920 --> 01:41.000
You have to help him!

01:41.290 --> 01:42.630
Listen...

01:42.920 --> 01:45.380
Don't get the wrong idea.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.130
I didn't come to help you.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.790
What the...?

01:51.830 --> 01:53.750
What the hell is that?

01:55.790 --> 01:58.080
You idiot. Don't turn around.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.330
Slowly walk towards me
one step at a time...

02:06.880 --> 02:09.919
<i>My heart's racing.</i>
<i>My skin's tingling.</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:12.670
<i>This is...definitely a red flag.</i>

02:13.830 --> 02:15.130
<i>This thing is strong.</i>

02:15.500 --> 02:18.380
<i>Fighting it here is</i>
<i>the last thing I want.</i>

02:19.670 --> 02:22.040
- Old dude...
- Shh! Quiet.

02:22.420 --> 02:23.670
Don't provoke it...

02:24.330 --> 02:25.710
Slowly...

02:26.000 --> 02:27.580
Just move... carefully...

02:30.380 --> 02:31.420
Go...

02:31.880 --> 02:32.960
But don't run...

02:37.250 --> 02:40.330
Alright...
It's not coming after us.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.250
As long as we don't show hostility,
we're good.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.790
Looks like we can get through this
without a fight.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.170
Phew...

02:48.250 --> 02:50.670
At this distance, we should be safe.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.960
So...it's you...

02:55.580 --> 02:59.460
You've decided to
join the humans, huh?

02:59.670 --> 03:02.210
This guy...
He's that Hero Hunter, right?

03:02.330 --> 03:04.960
Looks like you've gotten
a little too full of yourself.

03:05.330 --> 03:09.040
You should've sided with us
from the start, Hero Hunter!

03:09.420 --> 03:13.920
As you wish,
I'll douse you with toxic chemicals.

03:14.170 --> 03:16.130
So just die already!

03:28.040 --> 03:29.750
This... This guy's tough!

03:35.630 --> 03:36.670
Wow...

03:36.750 --> 03:37.750
Old dude...

03:38.380 --> 03:39.960
You're getting even stronger...

03:42.960 --> 03:43.960
Oh...!

03:44.040 --> 03:47.630
So you really do live up
to the name Hero Hunter.

03:48.580 --> 03:51.420
I'm used to being outnumbered.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.040
Yeah, but we're all threat-level Demon!

03:54.580 --> 03:58.420
Hmm...then I must
be threat-level Dragon.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.000
Hey, don't get cocky.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.960
Threat-level Dragon is for
Monster Association's top brass.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.290
You're nowhere near that level.

04:07.630 --> 04:10.250
Besides, you think you've already won?

04:10.380 --> 04:11.380
Don't be naive!

04:11.500 --> 04:12.540
Die!

04:12.670 --> 04:14.670
I've got the world's hardest horn.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.579
Humph. They're all nothing special...

04:26.130 --> 04:27.630
Ah, crap.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.750
Old dude, it's bad over there.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.750
H-Helllp! Ugh.

04:39.130 --> 04:42.290
I thought it was
the world's hardest horn.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.960
Pochi...

04:44.080 --> 04:45.250
This is bad.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.880
You pissed off one our high rankers.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.750
This thing's a high ranker?
It's just a dog!

04:49.960 --> 04:52.250
Our hierarchy is based
on destructiveness.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.250
<i>So, what now?</i>

04:56.710 --> 04:59.880
THREAT LEVEL: DRAGON
OVERGROWN POCHI

05:00.630 --> 05:01.920
Whoa, what the hell!

05:05.170 --> 05:07.580
With my regeneration,
I should be able to recover.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.420
RUMBLE BOOM

05:17.000 --> 05:18.630
Oh...an earthquake?

05:18.880 --> 05:20.250
I wonder where the epicenter was.

05:21.630 --> 05:23.540
After I read this,
maybe I'll go patrol the area.

05:23.630 --> 05:24.630
FLOP

05:40.080 --> 05:43.130
<i>So this is how strong the Monster</i>
<i>Associations' high rankers are?</i>

05:43.710 --> 05:45.790
<i>This is threat-level Dragon!!</i>

05:46.960 --> 05:49.130
This is where we split up!

05:50.380 --> 05:52.580
Why the hell are you
just standing there?

05:52.670 --> 05:54.080
Hurry up and move it!

05:54.330 --> 05:57.920
N-No way.
I'd never survive alone!

05:58.040 --> 06:01.830
- So what? That's not my problem.
- But...

06:01.920 --> 06:04.380
You're gonna drag me down
and get me killed too!

06:05.000 --> 06:09.210
You got lucky and survived.
Now take care of yourself!

06:22.710 --> 06:24.540
Hey, keep your eyes on me!

06:35.920 --> 06:37.670
How's that?
Was it even a little...

06:41.380 --> 06:43.080
Too...close...

06:45.040 --> 06:46.750
DEATH

06:48.040 --> 06:49.080
<i>I'm dead!</i>

06:49.210 --> 06:51.460
<i>Damn it. Here, of all places.</i>

06:51.540 --> 06:54.460
<i>I said I wanna fight</i>
<i>monster-class heroes.</i>

06:54.580 --> 06:57.420
<i>I never once said</i>
<i>I wanna fight monsters!</i>

06:58.710 --> 07:00.330
<i>I wanna drink a cola so bad.</i>

07:00.460 --> 07:03.580
<i>I'm not even halfway done!</i>
<i>But this is the end...</i>

08:16.330 --> 08:19.420
Don't get cocky, you damn mutt!

08:23.960 --> 08:29.380
Sit... Dog...gyyy!!

08:38.710 --> 08:41.039
Even my best shot didn't do a thing!

08:53.130 --> 08:55.040
RUMBLE BOOM

08:55.170 --> 08:57.080
SHAKING

09:03.960 --> 09:06.750
<i>I've fallen pretty deep</i>
<i>into the lower levels.</i>

09:06.960 --> 09:08.080
<i>Damn it.</i>

09:08.210 --> 09:10.290
<i>I must get back up there.</i>

09:10.960 --> 09:13.210
Ugh...I can't move.

09:13.540 --> 09:18.330
Well, look who dropped in.
So you're the intruder.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.790
Well, this is wonderful.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.790
You've lived up to my expectations.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.040
You didn't die, after all.

09:27.420 --> 09:28.670
I'm truly pleased.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.330
<i>The power to move things remotely...</i>

09:39.500 --> 09:41.000
<i>So that's telekinesis, huh?</i>

09:41.460 --> 09:42.750
Gyoro-Gyoro...

09:43.040 --> 09:45.420
How dare you have your goons
come after me.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.880
You've made this
a huge pain in the ass.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.830
What just happened?

09:53.210 --> 09:54.290
<i>I can't move...</i>

09:54.420 --> 09:55.960
There's no point in resisting.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.130
<i>In such a short time,</i>
<i>he has grown so much.</i>

10:00.790 --> 10:05.630
Hey... Release me right now...

10:05.830 --> 10:07.040
Or else...

10:14.380 --> 10:16.630
Let's chat a bit, shall we?

10:17.420 --> 10:19.380
BRUSHING

10:19.500 --> 10:21.080
PULLING

10:27.460 --> 10:31.130
Right now,
you're still only a half-monster.

10:31.670 --> 10:35.250
But it's terrifying that
you have the physical strength

10:35.330 --> 10:37.580
to be able to endure Pochi's
concentrated heat blasts.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.580
But it's still not enough.

10:42.540 --> 10:47.130
I can train you to become
the most powerful monster.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.920
You train me?

10:50.330 --> 10:53.040
So you're gonna teach me telekinesis?

10:53.580 --> 10:57.170
What I teach is neither
psychic powers nor martial arts.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.460
I will teach you the secret art
of monsterization.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.170
To put it simply

11:01.250 --> 11:04.250
you must repeatedly overcome death
as a human being.

11:04.380 --> 11:08.420
Subjecting both body and mind
to overwhelming, abnormal strain.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.040
It sounds simple,
but in truth it's incredibly difficult.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.500
Most subjects die right away.

11:14.790 --> 11:19.960
The key is to make them experience
a hell precisely tailored to their level.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.830
Sounds like
you've done it a few times.

11:22.960 --> 11:28.420
More than a few. I've used
countless humans and monsters.

11:28.960 --> 11:33.330
Monsterization became easy

11:33.420 --> 11:37.460
but the transformations only reflected
the individual's natural talents.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.420
There was no further growth.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.960
I desperately wanted to know how
to surpass the limits of growth.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.880
I tried feeding
monsters to other monsters

11:48.960 --> 11:52.540
transplanting blood and cells,
and forced breeding.

11:52.630 --> 11:54.960
I tried everything I could think of.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.960
And through that process

11:57.040 --> 12:01.250
I realized that by overcoming death,
you ascend to a higher stage.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.000
With each repetition,
they show explosive growth.

12:05.670 --> 12:08.380
A mountain of failures piled up.

12:08.670 --> 12:11.750
Then I found my first success...

12:12.210 --> 12:14.670
Monster King Orochi.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.460
But you hold even
greater potential than him.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.790
After you clashed with King the Ripper

12:20.880 --> 12:23.460
you broke through another wall.

12:23.750 --> 12:26.080
Your monsterization
is progressing steadily.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.130
You're becoming stronger and stronger.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.540
If you follow my training program

12:30.630 --> 12:32.540
you could become a monster like Orochi...

12:32.670 --> 12:36.500
Or even surpass him.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.080
Let's join forces.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.080
You can become
the most powerful monster

12:40.170 --> 12:43.130
and together we can erase
every hero from this world.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.250
I'll make your dreams come true.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.040
I don't need your help.

12:47.170 --> 12:48.750
I never want anything
to do with you.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.830
From the moment
I set my eyes on you

12:50.920 --> 12:53.080
refusal was no longer an option.

12:53.210 --> 12:57.380
I really hate guys who just sit back
and watch from above.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.290
Makes me want to drag them
down to the bottom.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.960
You're all talk.
You can't even move.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.040
This is my psychic power.

13:07.170 --> 13:11.210
Surpassing even Tornado and Blizzard,
the famed witch sisters.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.790
My powers are godly.

13:15.330 --> 13:20.790
Little...by little...
Little by little...

13:21.290 --> 13:23.330
I'm getting used to it.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.080
Why can you still move?

13:25.830 --> 13:27.080
Who knows?

13:27.630 --> 13:30.630
Maybe this is what
they call sheer willpower.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.210
<i>His ability to adapt is extraordinary.</i>

13:33.330 --> 13:36.130
<i>Taming him will not be easy.</i>

13:37.130 --> 13:39.790
I'll train you through pain.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.830
So that's all you've got?

13:59.080 --> 14:02.830
Hard to believe you're the
Monster Association's top strategist.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.380
When you hurl something,
the paralysis wears off.

14:06.710 --> 14:09.920
You can only focus on
one action at a time.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.000
That's why I can block it in an instant,
so you're no threat to me.

14:13.130 --> 14:15.580
Your psychic powers don't
scare me one damn bit.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.210
The only mediocre monster here is you!

14:22.830 --> 14:27.000
You don't have what it takes
to train a genius like me!

14:27.540 --> 14:30.630
I'm lucky that I dropped in
just where I needed to be.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.460
If I just crush the brains behind
the Monster Association

14:33.540 --> 14:35.500
the rest will collapse on its own.

14:40.630 --> 14:41.670
It's hunting time.

14:42.040 --> 14:46.960
The heroes are coming,
so don't tire me out.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.920
I need to preserve my energy.

14:51.380 --> 14:53.080
So...

14:53.380 --> 14:56.880
Lord Orochi! Finish him off!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.040
What?

15:04.170 --> 15:05.790
I wish you luck.

15:06.710 --> 15:07.750
Damn you.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.830
Ah, so it ends here, huh?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.460
I wanna know what happens next.

15:26.960 --> 15:27.960
BOOM

15:28.040 --> 15:29.920
<i>Oh, there's that rumbling</i>
<i>and noise again.</i>

15:30.750 --> 15:33.040
<i>This feels like something</i>
<i>out of the manga I'm reading.</i>

15:33.130 --> 15:34.130
RUMBLE

15:34.210 --> 15:36.500
<i>Come to think of it, in real life,</i>
<i>you never see stuff like</i>

15:36.580 --> 15:39.750
<i>a super-strong boss behind</i>
<i>the enemy organization.</i>

15:42.630 --> 15:45.080
<i>And things like final bosses</i>
<i>don't even exist.</i>

15:45.790 --> 15:47.790
RUMBLE

15:47.960 --> 15:50.000
Hold on.
Things are about to get crazy...

15:50.080 --> 15:52.500
KABOOM

15:53.670 --> 15:57.460
<i>Reality is nothing like manga.</i>
<i>There's nothing fun about it.</i>

15:58.460 --> 16:03.290
Lord Orochi! I have plans for him,
so don't kill him.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.880
Oh? You're still getting back up?

16:16.210 --> 16:18.710
Where does that
tenacity even come from?

16:19.130 --> 16:21.500
Well, not that it really matters.

16:45.460 --> 16:48.380
The horns were
the first part to manifest

16:48.460 --> 16:50.670
when Lord Orochi transformed
from human to monster.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.130
They've got incredible reach,
and he can control them freely.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.830
They're quite formidable, aren't they?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.579
No problem.

17:05.460 --> 17:10.250
I already got a hole
blown through my torso earlier...

17:46.130 --> 17:47.500
<i>He's getting faster.</i>

17:59.540 --> 18:01.710
<i>This is going nowhere</i>
<i>if I just keep dodging.</i>

18:09.790 --> 18:12.670
<i>Since he was once human, his vital points</i>
<i>should be in the same place.</i>

18:13.040 --> 18:15.080
<i>I'll hammer it into that massive target.</i>

18:23.960 --> 18:25.000
What the—?!

18:38.330 --> 18:40.000
Whoa!

18:40.170 --> 18:43.290
First, a dog monster and
now a giant worm boss?

18:45.540 --> 18:46.630
<i>Crap.</i>

18:57.790 --> 19:00.920
<i>He easily withstands extreme heat.</i>

19:47.210 --> 19:50.040
Lord Orochi has been perfected
as the ultimate lifeform.

19:50.130 --> 19:54.080
Your level is far beneath his.
Give up already.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.630
Don't make me laugh.

20:01.380 --> 20:06.000
I'm a genius,
so the same attacks won't work twice.

20:06.710 --> 20:09.170
Watch carefully,
I'm about to turn this around.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.000
This thing is definitely strong.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.880
But that's all he is.

20:14.460 --> 20:17.290
He lacks what it takes
to call himself the Monster King.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.500
Lacks what?

20:19.580 --> 20:21.290
He's not scary at all.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.630
There's not enough fear.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.380
Hmm...

20:25.880 --> 20:29.500
I'll give you...

20:29.830 --> 20:31.130
fear.

20:33.540 --> 20:37.130
<i>What I lack in physical strength,</i>
<i>I'll make up for in technique.</i>

20:43.460 --> 20:45.420
Come on, be afraid!

20:59.130 --> 21:00.710
Are you kidding?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.630
<i>He's using the same stance as me.</i>

21:02.960 --> 21:05.960
Did you think you're the only genius?

21:06.500 --> 21:10.580
He can copy your moves and techniques
just by seeing them once.

21:11.210 --> 21:14.580
Looks like you ended up making
Lord Orochi even stronger.

21:14.880 --> 21:19.290
You want fear? I'll give you fear.

21:21.330 --> 21:25.130
So you managed to copy
my technique with just one look?

21:25.710 --> 21:29.130
How considerate of you to match
my fighting style.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.920
You're too kind.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.830
You'll regret this!

21:42.960 --> 21:45.580
Your obsession with defeating heroes.

21:45.710 --> 21:48.080
Your strong admiration for monsters.

21:48.210 --> 21:52.540
And yet, you show no signs of
monstrous impulses or desires.

21:53.130 --> 21:55.630
Can you not abandon your humanity?

21:56.330 --> 21:57.750
The more pure-hearted they are

21:57.830 --> 22:01.540
the greater the inner conflict,
creating cracks in their heart.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.630
I'll take my time and
thoroughly brainwash you.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.380
You can never have
too many trump cards.

22:08.500 --> 22:13.580
The Hero Association might be hiding
some cards above Class S as well.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.830
There was definitely noise
coming from below.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.630
Hm? But now, it's gone quiet.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.130
OPEN

23:56.000 --> 24:00.920
MOTLEY HEROES
