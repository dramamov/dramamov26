I'm here.

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:47.651
How adorable.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:49.886

In my 20s,

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:06.737
I thought 40 would never come.

00:02:08.472 --> 00:02:10.941
But now I'm 41.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:13.977
Even by Korean age, I'm 40.

00:02:15.212 --> 00:02:17.080
I still feel young at heart,

00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.683
but the world says I'm middle-aged.

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:23.954
By now, I thought life would be easier,

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:27.190
yet I still stumble and lose my way.

Hello.

00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:32.696
Dear subscribers of N Life Magazine,

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:34.564
welcome to the popular segment,

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:38.435

- Yes?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.342
Why do you look so happy today?

00:02:45.342 --> 00:02:47.010
Was it that obvious?

00:02:47.344 --> 00:02:49.746
Everyone, our channel...

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:52.883
finally hit 500,000 subscribers.

00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:57.721
And that's all thanks
to the Blunt Sister's sharp words...

00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:01.158
that have saved countless hearts in love.

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:02.392
I'm honored.

00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:06.196
Then, shall we listen to today's story...

00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:07.831
from someone waiting for a tough truth?

00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:08.699
Let's start.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:09.533
Go ahead.

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:12.569
I broke up after three years of dating.

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.205
I peeked at my ex's Instagram,

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:18.408
and within a week, he'd posted photos
with a new girlfriend.

00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:21.578
And that girl is prettier than me.
That's so annoying.

00:03:21.578 --> 00:03:23.580
That's totally annoying.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.616
Even when it's over,
you still compare, get bothered,

00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:26.650
and your pride gets hurt.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.785
- I really hate that kind of thing.
- Same here.

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:29.987
What should she do?

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.290
First,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.858
during this period, above all else,

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:38.028
beware of promotional cosmetic procedures
and impulsive plastic surgery.

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:39.329
- What?
- What?

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.263
Because,

00:03:40.464 --> 00:03:42.799
while you're busy stalking their feed,

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.668
the algorithm that's reading your heart...

00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:46.737
will bombard you with ads.

"Add some filler under your eyes."

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.507
"Do a lifting procedure.
Try this procedure."

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:52.376
"You can look prettier than her."

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:54.111
But you know
that if you get procedures in this state,

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:56.046
you lose rational thinking, right?

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:57.347
You start with what's necessary,

00:03:57.347 --> 00:03:59.516
then one thing leads to another.

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:01.785
The savings you've been building are gone.

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:03.320
And before you know it,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.289
your face is puffed up like a balloon.

(N Life Magazine)

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:12.896
But really,

00:04:12.896 --> 00:04:16.033
how many people can truly avoid
checking an ex's Instagram?

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.634
Nine out of ten probably peek, right?

00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:19.369
Of course, I totally get that feeling.

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:21.538
But that's exactly when you must be firm.

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:24.207
There's nothing more unattractive
than someone who can't let go.

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:26.977
Then, Deputy Editor,
if Director Jong Do broke up with you,

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:28.912
are you confident you wouldn't cling?

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:30.614
Cling?

00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:31.682
Woo Ram.

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:35.052
I've stayed loyal, turning down
so many guys who liked me,

00:04:35.052 --> 00:04:38.388
just to keep this clean relationship.
And I feel sorry about that.

00:04:38.388 --> 00:04:39.323
So if we broke up,

00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:42.526
I'd dive headfirst
into the infinite world of freedom.

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:43.627
Cling? No way.

00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:45.963

to check the lighting angles.

to put things back after drawing?

Don't do that.

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:36.300
Mom, the candy won't unwrap.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.535
Honey, the kids say they're uncomfortable.

- why didn't you come home yourself?
- My peepee's tight.

Okay, I'm getting a call.

- I'll call you back.

Let's go.

00:08:32.723 --> 00:08:34.291
Mom, let's go back to the vroom-vroom.

00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:35.525
Why?

00:08:35.525 --> 00:08:38.795
I forgot my wee-woo car there.

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:41.965
Right. I left my candy.

00:08:42.766 --> 00:08:43.834
Look.

00:08:43.834 --> 00:08:46.637
The wee-woo car is sleeping
in the vroom-vroom right now.

00:08:46.637 --> 00:08:49.272
Min Woo, there'll be even better treats
where we're going.

00:08:49.272 --> 00:08:49.906
So let's go now.

00:08:50.907 --> 00:08:52.009
Why?

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:53.810
You said if I don't take my toys,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.613
the Toy Fairy will take them.

00:08:56.613 --> 00:08:58.982
What if the Fairy takes the candy?

00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:00.984
What if the fairy takes it?

00:09:00.984 --> 00:09:01.952
No, the fairy can't take it.

00:09:01.952 --> 00:09:04.521
The fairy can't take it
because it's in the vroom-vroom.

00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:07.291
No, she'll take it.

00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.427
- No, wee-woo.
- Candy.

00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:11.795
Add some filler under your eyes.

00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:13.430
Get a lifting procedure.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.332
You can look prettier than her.

00:09:15.332 --> 00:09:17.067
But you know
that if you get procedures in this state,

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:18.902
you lose rational thinking, right?

00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:20.170
You start with what's necessary...

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.505
This looks good, right?

00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:23.573
Yes, this place had great reviews.

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:25.776
I said no.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:28.879
- The vroom-vroom.
- Let's go back.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:31.682
- Mom, the vroom-vroom.
- Wee-woo.

00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:34.785
Okay, I'll get it for you.

00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:37.354
Act like you don't know her.

00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:40.924
See? I told you
we should've just gone to her house.

00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:42.526
Hey.

00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:45.062
Yes.

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:47.130
Vroom-vroom.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.333
Yes, I know. Your aunties are over there.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.035
Let's go say hi to them first.

00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:22.566
Is it good?

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:23.634
Yes.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.638
I got your things.

00:10:27.638 --> 00:10:29.806
Min Woo and Min Jun, how about
we go to the playroom over there,

00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:31.208
play a bit,
and then come back to eat more?

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:32.175
- Okay.
- All right.

00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:35.078
- Go have fun.
- Mom, we'll be back.

00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:35.879
Okay.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.080
- You can eat.
- Thanks.

00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:42.286
- Can I eat this?
- Sure.

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:49.760
It's good.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.198
Hey, is someone chasing you or what?

00:10:55.198 --> 00:10:56.900
Eat slowly. You'll choke.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.368
I have to eat while I can,

00:10:58.602 --> 00:11:00.270
before my kids launch another attack.

00:11:03.106 --> 00:11:04.641
Hey, have some of this too.

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:07.844
Thanks. Gu Joo Young, you're the best.

00:11:09.846 --> 00:11:12.316
Hey, do your hair once in a while.

00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:16.219
And those shoes. Seriously?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.289
If I saw you on the street,
I wouldn't recognize you.

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:20.257
Look who's talking.

00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:22.492
You.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.962
I barely recognized you too.

00:11:24.962 --> 00:11:26.530
Who is this?

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.031
Who is this? Do you know her?

00:11:28.665 --> 00:11:29.566
Just eat.

00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:33.971
It looks like Min Woo's atopy's gotten
much better, seeing you bring him out.

00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:36.540
- Yes, it's almost all gone.
- I see.

00:11:36.773 --> 00:11:38.442
Then aren't you going back to work?

00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:40.610
My baby's still young.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.646
Wanting to work already would be greedy.

00:11:43.347 --> 00:11:45.549
Just watching the kids
grow up healthy is...

00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:47.918
is enough to make me happy.

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:50.721
Hey, hurry up
and give Naraeng her present already.

00:11:51.655 --> 00:11:53.423
I can't wait.

00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:55.225
Have a hot night, ma'am.

00:12:04.067 --> 00:12:07.371
Did we really not know each other
this well?

00:12:08.438 --> 00:12:09.906
I'm a C cup.

00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:10.607
What?

00:12:11.174 --> 00:12:12.442
You? A C cup?

00:12:12.442 --> 00:12:15.479
What are you saying?
You're an A cup, a flat A.

00:12:15.479 --> 00:12:16.213
Yes.

00:12:16.213 --> 00:12:18.548
Well, maybe I gained weight.

00:12:18.548 --> 00:12:20.350
Or from breastfeeding.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.819
Cho Naraeng, take better care of yourself.

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:24.388
You've really let go.

00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:27.190
Do you know what the counseling topic was
last week on Blunt Sister's?

00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:30.794
The reasons men lose sexual attraction
to their wives.

00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:32.362
Number one, nagging.

00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:33.930
Number two, ruined body shape.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.999
Number three, sloppy outfit.

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:37.768
Seriously?

00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:40.370
- That's too aggressive.
- Yes.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.906
Do women really have to manage the house,
raise the kids,

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:44.875
and still keep up perfect self-care?

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:46.143
What I'm saying is,

00:12:46.143 --> 00:12:49.179
why do married people lose
all sense of sexual tension...

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:50.814
so carelessly?

00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:51.848
So?

00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:54.484
You think you could keep looking like that
if you got married?

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:56.053
You know I'm not interested in marriage.

00:12:57.554 --> 00:12:58.989
- Why? What?
- You?

00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:02.826
Stop playing hard to get
and just propose yourself.

00:13:02.826 --> 00:13:04.561
Whoever wants it should say so first.

00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:06.129
What are you waiting for?

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:08.999
How many times do I have to say it?
I don't want to marry.

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:11.868
Yes, I hear you.

00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:17.174
I even booked a dermatologist appointment,
but I can't go now.

00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:21.111
Why did the Executive Director
even plan this ridiculous project?

00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:22.312
Exactly.

00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:24.448
We're going to end up
cleaning up the mess anyway.

00:13:24.448 --> 00:13:25.582
Right.

00:13:25.582 --> 00:13:27.184
You're here, Executive Director.

00:13:28.251 --> 00:13:29.786
Hello.

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:32.556
It must've been tough working
on-site today.

00:13:32.556 --> 00:13:34.825
How's the interviewee arrangement going?

00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:36.994
I've already booked them.

00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:39.896
We're doing this big event
just for that one news segment.

00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:43.033
You made sure they memorized
the expected questions, right?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.235
Of course, Executive Director.
Don't worry.

00:13:48.338 --> 00:13:50.374
And my editor-in-chief is like,

00:13:50.374 --> 00:13:53.210
"The age of print is over.
Channel content is the future."

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.444
while scolding us to death.

00:13:54.444 --> 00:13:55.379
Mom, wipe me.

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.714
Okay, here.

00:13:57.714 --> 00:13:58.915
Yes, go on.

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:00.951
Meanwhile, the editor...

00:14:00.951 --> 00:14:03.086
- Mom, wipe me.
- still clings to print layouts and...

00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:03.787
Here.

00:14:05.289 --> 00:14:06.356
I see.

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:10.294
Hey.

00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:14.097
You finally go out after years, and you
couldn't find someone to watch the kids?

00:14:14.364 --> 00:14:16.300
I was going to leave them with my husband,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.001
but something came up at his office.

00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:18.969
Sorry.

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:20.237
Seriously.

00:14:20.237 --> 00:14:22.072
This is why I hate marriage.

00:14:22.973 --> 00:14:25.208
When you have kids,
the mom's stuck doing everything.

00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:26.877
And yet the country keeps saying
"Have kids."

00:14:26.877 --> 00:14:28.312
Like the country's going
to raise them for you.

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:29.880
I know, right?

00:14:30.747 --> 00:14:32.516
But poor Na Jeong.

00:14:32.516 --> 00:14:33.917
She's not someone
who should just rot like this.

00:14:35.018 --> 00:14:36.386
Cho Na Jeong.

00:14:36.386 --> 00:14:38.722
Stop pretending you're fine
and just be honest already.

00:14:39.656 --> 00:14:40.557
What?

00:14:40.557 --> 00:14:41.959
I really am fine.

00:14:44.728 --> 00:14:46.363
What's with this atmosphere?

00:14:46.363 --> 00:14:49.466
Calling someone who's living her life...

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:51.768
"rotting" is crossing the line,
don't you think?

00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:53.570
I mean...

00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:57.607
I didn't mean
to belittle stay-at-home moms.

00:14:57.607 --> 00:14:59.076
Hey, we know you.

00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:00.944
You always wanted to keep working.

00:15:01.178 --> 00:15:02.346
Not anymore.

00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:04.181
Right now, family's what matters most.

00:15:05.482 --> 00:15:06.450
Really?

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.085
Yes, really.

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:11.922
Why are you
suddenly making me sound pitiful?

00:15:13.423 --> 00:15:14.358
No,

00:15:14.591 --> 00:15:15.626
I just...

00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:24.601
Excuse me.

00:15:27.804 --> 00:15:28.672
Hey.

00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:31.475
Why are you getting so defensive
over nothing?

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:46.857
What is it all of a sudden?

00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:50.661
It looks like there's another problem
with the office server.

00:15:51.495 --> 00:15:52.929
It's the server this time?

00:15:53.597 --> 00:15:55.098
And last time it was a company dinner.

00:15:55.098 --> 00:15:57.000
It's true! Don't you believe me?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.635
Would you believe you?

00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:04.408
You can't be late today.

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:06.643
The doctor said 8:30 p.m.

00:16:07.277 --> 00:16:08.245
Okay?

00:16:08.245 --> 00:16:10.380
Yeah, okay. See you later.

00:16:18.155 --> 00:16:19.056
Was it your husband?

00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:20.324
Yes.

00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:23.160
How's Sang Min doing?

00:16:23.694 --> 00:16:26.430
My husband said Sang Min's game...

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.031
blew up in China.

00:16:28.732 --> 00:16:30.968
Yes, it's doing pretty well.

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:33.737
That's great.

00:16:35.038 --> 00:16:36.206
I'm jealous, you lucky girl.

00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:40.877
Last time you said you were trying
for a baby. How's that going?

00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:42.613
Are you guys keeping busy?

00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:43.880
How many times a week?

00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:46.216
Not much. We're both busy.

00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:48.118
A baby?

00:16:48.785 --> 00:16:51.088
Hey, don't.

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:53.724
Haven't you heard "Childless is best?"

00:16:54.725 --> 00:16:57.661
And if you have one after 40,

00:16:57.661 --> 00:16:59.463
You'll go downhill fast.

00:16:59.863 --> 00:17:00.731
So don't.

00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:03.934
Didn't you just say
raising kids is the greatest joy?

00:17:05.268 --> 00:17:07.571
Yes, it is.

00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:10.807
Sure, watching them grow is beautiful.

00:17:10.807 --> 00:17:12.242
Sure, they're beautiful and all,

00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:15.245
but I'm just worried you might struggle.

00:17:15.245 --> 00:17:16.446
You're worried that I'll struggle?

00:17:17.914 --> 00:17:20.117
You tell someone not to try for a baby…

00:17:20.117 --> 00:17:21.251
because you think they’ll struggle?

00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:24.321
Gu Joo Young, why do you sound so harsh?

00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:25.622
What did I do?

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:27.858
She's the one who started it.

00:17:29.026 --> 00:17:30.994
One minute she says
the best thing she's ever done...

00:17:30.994 --> 00:17:32.796
is have kids,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.498
and the next she tells me not to have one.

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:37.734
What are you really trying to say?

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.470
I just...

00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:46.343
Who's the mother of this kid?

00:17:47.244 --> 00:17:49.012
Why would you leave a child
unattended in a restaurant?

00:17:56.954 --> 00:17:59.122
Min Jun, are you okay?

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.461
Na Jeong?

00:18:05.562 --> 00:18:06.330
Ye Na.

00:18:06.596 --> 00:18:08.098
Is this your son?

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.201
Cho Na Jeong?

00:18:12.336 --> 00:18:13.270
Long time no see.

00:18:14.338 --> 00:18:16.306
- Why wasn't she watching her son?
- Hello, Executive Director.

00:18:16.306 --> 00:18:18.275
- How annoying.
- What happened?

00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:21.545
Well, I was at the salad bar,

00:18:21.545 --> 00:18:24.548
and this boy suddenly came up
and touched my butt.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.419
Noh Min Jun, did you really do that?

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:30.253
Yes.

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:32.122
Na Jeong, what were you doing
not watching your kid...

00:18:32.122 --> 00:18:33.190
at a restaurant?

00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:35.926
I'm sorry, Executive Director.

00:18:36.893 --> 00:18:38.295
Ye Na, I'm sorry.

00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:40.097
You must've been really startled.

00:18:40.097 --> 00:18:42.065
Well, yes, a bit.

00:18:42.532 --> 00:18:44.735
Especially since it was my butt,
of all places.

00:18:48.238 --> 00:18:49.740
No way! Blunt Sister!

00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:52.409
Hello.

00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:54.344
I'm a big fan of yours.

00:18:57.848 --> 00:19:01.251
I didn't know you two were friends.

00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:07.824
Then, enjoy your meal.

00:19:09.226 --> 00:19:10.327
I'm sorry, Executive Director.

00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:12.629
Ye Na, I'm really sorry.

00:19:13.997 --> 00:19:14.831
Okay.

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.166
Bye.

00:19:16.366 --> 00:19:18.368
She should've gone to a no-kids zone.

00:19:18.902 --> 00:19:20.470
Honestly, she's got no sense at all.

00:19:22.372 --> 00:19:23.307
Let's go.

00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:25.475
Say goodbye to the aunties.

00:19:25.475 --> 00:19:26.943
Bye.

00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:29.246
Hey, you can't just leave like this.

00:19:29.246 --> 00:19:32.082
This is your first birthday party out
in six years.

00:19:32.082 --> 00:19:32.849
No.

00:19:33.383 --> 00:19:35.686
I was reckless to come out with the kids.

00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:37.888
Na Jeong, I went too far earlier about...

00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:39.923
No, I'm sorry.

00:19:40.424 --> 00:19:42.826
You tried to celebrate my birthday
and ended up getting scolded.

00:19:42.826 --> 00:19:45.128
I shouldn't have suggested
meeting outside.

00:19:45.362 --> 00:19:47.130
I just wanted you to get some fresh air.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.832
I know.

00:19:49.132 --> 00:19:51.601
But I think it's still just my greed.

00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:53.370
I'll call you later. Sorry.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.539
Let's go. Min Woo, Min Jun, let's go.

00:20:01.478 --> 00:20:02.279
Hey.

00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:04.881
Why did you act so unlike yourself?

00:20:15.425 --> 00:20:16.360
Min Jun.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.028
Why did you do that before?

00:20:20.831 --> 00:20:22.699
Be honest with me.

00:20:23.734 --> 00:20:25.836
Did you really touch the lady's butt?

00:20:28.205 --> 00:20:30.641
Min Jun, you learned this at daycare.

00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:32.676
You must not touch other people's bodies.

00:20:32.676 --> 00:20:34.011
That's Mom.

00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:35.312
That's Mom, right?

00:20:35.479 --> 00:20:37.281
Why is your photo up there, Mom?

00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:41.451
(2018 Cho Na Jeong)

00:20:47.691 --> 00:20:48.692
That's not me.

00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:49.826
Let's go.

00:20:50.794 --> 00:20:52.929
What do you expect me to do
by telling me that now?

00:20:53.597 --> 00:20:55.065
If I get fired because of you,

00:20:55.065 --> 00:20:56.266
are you going to take responsibility?

00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:00.504
Na Jeong.

00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:13.617
Talk to me.

00:21:14.017 --> 00:21:15.552
Why did you talk to Na Jeong like that?

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.455
You can't fool me.

00:21:18.822 --> 00:21:20.090
We've been friends for 20 years.

00:21:20.857 --> 00:21:22.926
If you're struggling, say so.
If you're upset, say so.

00:21:22.926 --> 00:21:24.161
Why can't you just say it?

00:21:25.028 --> 00:21:25.929
Exactly.

00:21:27.197 --> 00:21:27.998
What is it?

00:21:28.768 --> 00:21:31.668
Are you having trouble trying to conceive?

00:21:32.736 --> 00:21:33.570
Yeah.

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:37.274
You have no idea how miserable it is...

00:21:37.274 --> 00:21:38.842
to sleep with your husband
just to make a baby.

00:21:39.843 --> 00:21:42.112
My mom's anxious to death,

00:21:42.713 --> 00:21:45.082
the in-laws subtly blame it on my age,

00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:47.284
and my husband's not cooperative at all.

00:21:48.919 --> 00:21:50.387
It's stressing me out.

00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:53.624
But you still want a baby?

00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:57.361
I'm 41.

00:21:58.028 --> 00:22:00.497
Wait a little
and I won't be able to even if I want one.

00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:03.600
What if I regret it?

00:22:06.937 --> 00:22:09.573
The Executive Director
personally asked me to do this.

00:22:09.573 --> 00:22:11.642
But the friend
who was supposed to be interviewed says...

00:22:11.642 --> 00:22:14.044
her kid got sick
and she can't come last minute.

00:22:14.044 --> 00:22:16.446
It's going on the news.
We can't just have anyone do it.

00:22:16.446 --> 00:22:18.849
How can I do that without any prep?

00:22:19.583 --> 00:22:22.919
And honestly,
I don't even look presentable.

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:24.521
I don't even know the event's purpose.

00:22:25.355 --> 00:22:28.025
It's about hiring
career-interrupted women.

00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:30.861
Sorry. I don't think I can do it.

00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:31.828
But...

00:22:32.262 --> 00:22:33.363
the reporter says...

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.799
their schedule overlapped,
so we have to do it now.

00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:37.067
But people haven't even arrived yet.

00:22:37.534 --> 00:22:40.637
If you don't help me,
I'll get fired for real.

00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:47.711
What made you sign up
for this hiring fair?

00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:51.448
I used to work as a show host,

00:22:51.448 --> 00:22:53.283
but I quit because of my kids...

00:22:53.283 --> 00:22:55.218
about six years ago.

00:22:55.852 --> 00:22:58.889
Raising kids and running the house,

00:22:58.889 --> 00:23:02.125
I realized people called my name
less and less.

00:23:02.926 --> 00:23:05.796
So I'm not just here to find a job.

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:08.465
I want to live my life again.

00:23:08.732 --> 00:23:10.400
That's why I came.

00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:17.274
- Mom.
- Hey.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.511
Thanks, Cho Na Jeong.

00:23:22.312 --> 00:23:24.414
If not for you,
we might've lost a whole segment.

00:23:25.215 --> 00:23:26.149
You're welcome.

00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:27.684
All right, take care.

00:23:28.185 --> 00:23:29.019
Thanks.

00:23:30.253 --> 00:23:31.922
Take care, Na Jeong. Thank you.

00:23:31.922 --> 00:23:33.523
Great work, Na Jeong.

00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:34.558
Okay, let's go.

00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:37.928
Hold hands, Min Woo, Min Jun. Let's go.

00:23:38.095 --> 00:23:39.730
Let's ride the vroom-vroom home.

(2018, Home Shopping Host of the Year
Cho Na Jeong)

00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:00.584
Let's go.

00:24:15.265 --> 00:24:16.199
Thanks.

00:24:16.199 --> 00:24:17.067
You're welcome.

00:24:19.303 --> 00:24:20.137
Why?

00:24:21.004 --> 00:24:22.306
- Why?
- Hold still.

00:24:23.173 --> 00:24:24.474
People are looking.

00:24:24.474 --> 00:24:25.409
Hold still.

00:24:30.881 --> 00:24:31.715
What?

00:24:32.316 --> 00:24:33.250
Your eyelash.

00:24:34.618 --> 00:24:36.320
You could've just said so.

00:24:40.891 --> 00:24:41.758
Did you put syrup in this?

00:24:42.492 --> 00:24:45.162
How many times have I said
I don't take syrup?

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:46.830
Did you?

00:24:48.098 --> 00:24:49.066
Do you want me to order another one?

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:50.567
It's fine.

00:24:56.139 --> 00:24:58.542
Who are you texting?

00:24:59.009 --> 00:24:59.943
The filming team.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.312
Since we're going to Saipan,
I suggested we go surfing too,

00:25:02.312 --> 00:25:03.313
and they loved it.

00:25:03.313 --> 00:25:04.748
- Saipan?
- Yes.

00:25:05.248 --> 00:25:07.017
I have the KW photo shoot tomorrow.

00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:09.486
Why didn't you tell me?

00:25:10.654 --> 00:25:11.755
Didn't I?

00:25:14.157 --> 00:25:16.360
Why do you never share your schedule?

00:25:16.893 --> 00:25:20.097
Do I have to report every little thing?
That's so tacky.

00:25:30.941 --> 00:25:32.142
But...

00:25:32.142 --> 00:25:33.043
Yes?

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.545
We've got some time
before the movie, right?

00:25:36.446 --> 00:25:38.015
Since we're out,
do you want to go shopping?

00:25:38.482 --> 00:25:39.516
You want to buy something again?

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.785
Don't you save any money?

00:25:41.785 --> 00:25:43.887
What will you do
when you suddenly need a lump sum?

00:25:43.887 --> 00:25:45.522
Did something happen today or what?

00:25:46.323 --> 00:25:48.659
You've been nagging
like an old woman all day.

00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:49.559
Me?

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:52.763
The reasons men lose sexual attraction
to their wives.

00:25:52.763 --> 00:25:54.331
Number one, nagging.

00:25:56.133 --> 00:25:58.735
Right. I need to buy something.

00:25:58.969 --> 00:25:59.770
Let's go.

00:26:03.774 --> 00:26:04.675
Joo Young.

00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.244
The herbal tonics I bought
for both of you.

00:26:07.711 --> 00:26:09.079
Why are Sang Min's untouched?

00:26:09.713 --> 00:26:12.382
I brewed another batch
and put it in the fridge,

00:26:12.716 --> 00:26:14.217
so make sure Sang Min drinks it.

00:26:14.651 --> 00:26:16.153
If you don't tell men to take it,

00:26:16.153 --> 00:26:18.121
men never do.

(Gu Joo Young
May, June, July)

00:26:31.168 --> 00:26:31.902
Give it.

00:26:41.912 --> 00:26:42.846
- Right.
- What?

00:26:45.215 --> 00:26:46.183
Here's your credit card.

00:26:46.783 --> 00:26:47.584
Okay.

00:27:18.849 --> 00:27:19.950
Mom.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.718
- My girl.
- Yes?

00:27:21.718 --> 00:27:23.620
Did you eat the seaweed soup
I dropped off yesterday?

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.721
Yes, of course.

00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:26.156
I even went all the way to Majang-dong...

00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:28.759
to buy meat and simmer it for hours,

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:30.327
so don't leave any.

00:27:30.327 --> 00:27:33.497
That's why it was so delicious.

00:27:33.497 --> 00:27:36.199
The rich broth was truly amazing.

00:27:36.199 --> 00:27:38.602
Did you have fun with Il Ri and Joo Young?

00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:41.638
I'm with them now.

00:27:42.773 --> 00:27:45.375
It's been a while since I came downtown
and ate lots of good food...

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:47.444
and got some air. This feels amazing.

00:27:48.645 --> 00:27:50.614
Is Won Bin watching the kids?

00:27:51.348 --> 00:27:52.249
Yes.

00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:55.118
He even cleared the broadcasts
for my birthday.

00:27:55.686 --> 00:27:58.655
He's blunt but actually caring.

00:28:27.784 --> 00:28:30.153
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail...

00:29:32.716 --> 00:29:33.517
Honey.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.254
You're really angry, aren't you?

00:29:39.723 --> 00:29:41.558
Honey, wait a second.

00:29:41.558 --> 00:29:43.293
What are you doing? No.

00:29:43.293 --> 00:29:45.896
That's a Berserk limited edition.
There are only eight of them in Korea.

00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:47.164
Don't.

00:29:54.471 --> 00:29:55.339
Wait.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.185
Honey, I can explain everything.

00:30:08.185 --> 00:30:10.721
So this is a rare item
I've been hunting for months,

00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:12.556
and one popped up in Uijeongbu.

00:30:12.556 --> 00:30:13.423
I asked them to hold it,

00:30:13.423 --> 00:30:15.125
but they said I had to pick it up today
in case I changed my mind.

00:30:15.125 --> 00:30:17.160
I thought, "What a chance,"
so I rushed right out.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.796
But the Dongbu Highway was jammed,
and I was stuck there forever.

00:30:19.796 --> 00:30:21.198
Did you just say "chance?"

00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:24.034
Did you just say "chance?"

00:30:24.034 --> 00:30:24.968
Let's do it.

00:30:25.736 --> 00:30:26.670
Joo Young, let's do it now.

00:30:29.006 --> 00:30:29.906
Let's do it now.

00:30:30.474 --> 00:30:33.910
It's only been three hours
past our planned time.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.945
Three whole hours...

00:30:34.945 --> 00:30:36.947
It's three hours late,
but the egg will be fine.

00:30:36.947 --> 00:30:38.115
Should I ask the egg?

00:30:38.115 --> 00:30:39.750
Egg, how are you? You okay?

00:30:41.084 --> 00:30:43.587
It says it's fine, honey.
It says it's fine.

00:30:43.587 --> 00:30:44.955
Egg, hang on a bit.

00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:46.590
It's okay. Let's do it now.

00:30:47.557 --> 00:30:49.393
We can just do it now. It's fine.

00:30:55.299 --> 00:30:56.099
Let's do it now.

00:30:58.935 --> 00:30:59.736
Hurry.

00:31:23.727 --> 00:31:25.929
Honey, because of the traffic jam,

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:27.464
I didn't get to eat dinner.
Maybe that's why.

00:31:28.832 --> 00:31:30.467
Why won't he listen?

00:31:30.467 --> 00:31:32.469
I told him to listen.

00:31:33.437 --> 00:31:36.106
And lately I've been working out hard.

00:31:37.741 --> 00:31:38.875
Be quiet.

00:31:46.116 --> 00:31:47.117
I think these days...

00:31:48.352 --> 00:31:49.586
I'm under a lot of stress.

00:31:50.187 --> 00:31:52.923
I can't focus well.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.625
"These days?"

00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:56.727
"These days?"

00:31:56.727 --> 00:31:57.561
Okay.

00:31:59.363 --> 00:32:00.397
Then, how about...

00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:05.469
we make it exciting and go to a motel?

00:32:08.205 --> 00:32:09.006
Now?

00:32:09.172 --> 00:32:10.474
Not now.

00:32:11.642 --> 00:32:12.976
Maybe tomorrow would be good.

00:32:12.976 --> 00:32:16.046
Didn't I tell you
I'm busy starting tomorrow?

00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:18.715
How can you not listen
to a single word I say?

00:32:18.715 --> 00:32:19.549
Damn it.

00:32:31.795 --> 00:32:33.730
Honey, I'm really sorry.

00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:38.001
I got out of the taxi
and was walking here,

00:32:38.001 --> 00:32:41.138
and I tripped over there.

00:32:41.138 --> 00:32:43.307
But even if it looks like this,
the taste...

00:32:45.876 --> 00:32:46.977
It tastes fine.

00:32:46.977 --> 00:32:48.011
Here.

00:32:48.011 --> 00:32:48.845
Don't.

00:32:51.682 --> 00:32:52.950
Who did you drink with?

00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:58.021
A PD I know said he really needed to talk.

00:32:58.021 --> 00:32:59.089
About what?

00:32:59.723 --> 00:33:01.358
What was it that
you couldn't even tell him...

00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:03.327
you had to go home
for your wife's birthday?

00:33:05.028 --> 00:33:07.331
I'm not asking for anything big.

00:33:07.864 --> 00:33:09.266
I just want...

00:33:10.567 --> 00:33:13.036
to go out freely for once.

00:33:13.537 --> 00:33:16.740
To eat comfortably with my friends once.

00:33:16.974 --> 00:33:18.508
Is that such a hard thing to ask?

00:33:20.677 --> 00:33:21.845
Honey.

00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:23.380
Honey, I'm really sorry.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.716
But I even bought you a gift.

00:33:25.716 --> 00:33:27.351
Can't you at least open it before you go?

00:33:34.324 --> 00:33:35.125
Here.

00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:40.597
Open it.

00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:43.300
I really thought hard picking this out.

00:33:43.634 --> 00:33:46.803
What does my lovely wife really need?

00:33:46.803 --> 00:33:48.005
I pondered and pondered...

00:33:48.905 --> 00:33:50.974
Come on, open it.

00:33:57.147 --> 00:33:58.382
Pretty, right?

00:33:58.382 --> 00:34:00.617
Remember when
you were watching "My Stay"...

00:34:00.617 --> 00:34:02.986
and said this was so pretty?

00:34:02.986 --> 00:34:05.322
Let me put it on you.

00:34:05.322 --> 00:34:06.223
Wait.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.727
This is...

00:34:11.928 --> 00:34:13.130
waterproof too.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.466
You always said your front gets wet
all the time, right?

00:34:16.466 --> 00:34:17.934
I remembered that.

00:34:21.104 --> 00:34:22.439
It's really pretty.

00:34:30.347 --> 00:34:31.181
What's wrong?

00:34:33.317 --> 00:34:34.217
Honey.

00:34:35.519 --> 00:34:37.688
Do you think I do the dishes
because I enjoy it?

00:34:38.288 --> 00:34:40.657
Do you think I live like this
because I like it?

00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:42.559
No.

00:34:44.127 --> 00:34:45.362
Honestly,

00:34:47.064 --> 00:34:48.465
I want to work again.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.401
But...

00:34:53.603 --> 00:34:56.039
if I said that,
I thought I'd sound so selfish.

00:34:56.306 --> 00:34:57.574
That's why I didn't say it.

00:35:05.949 --> 00:35:07.884
Honey, don't cry.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.903
The pants I'll show you today
aren't just any old pants.

00:35:26.903 --> 00:35:30.440
Once people try them,
they regret buying only one or two.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.275
They want to stock up.

00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:35.178
These are the pants
that got tons of rave reviews.

00:35:35.178 --> 00:35:36.213
That's right.

00:35:36.213 --> 00:35:38.048
- I'm so excited.
- Yes.

00:35:38.048 --> 00:35:40.517
When you touch it,

00:35:40.517 --> 00:35:42.753
you'll notice the difference.

00:35:42.753 --> 00:35:44.488
This firm elasticity...

00:35:44.488 --> 00:35:46.857
and even this soft touch.

00:35:47.391 --> 00:35:49.993
It's made with spandex material,

00:35:50.994 --> 00:35:52.362
so it's really comfortable,

00:35:52.362 --> 00:35:55.265
yet the knees never stretch out.

00:35:55.265 --> 00:35:56.133
See?

00:35:56.767 --> 00:35:59.569
Instead, it hugs you firmly.

00:35:59.569 --> 00:36:00.370
Right?

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.372
And it's super easy to wash.

00:36:02.372 --> 00:36:03.907
You can just throw it in the machine.

00:36:03.907 --> 00:36:06.543
It hardly shrinks or stretches.

00:36:06.543 --> 00:36:09.913
And most importantly,
it doesn't bleed color.

00:36:09.913 --> 00:36:11.048
Exactly.

00:36:11.048 --> 00:36:13.283
This is why people say
they wear this every day.

00:36:13.283 --> 00:36:14.484
You see why, right?

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:19.256
Over 500 people are calling
to order right now.

00:36:19.957 --> 00:36:22.793
It feels like today could be...

00:36:22.793 --> 00:36:25.228
a rare sellout in jewelry history.

00:36:25.462 --> 00:36:27.164
Indeed, our customers know...

00:36:27.164 --> 00:36:30.400
what truly good products
and valuable choices are.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.135
They have exceptional taste.

00:36:32.135 --> 00:36:33.904
- That's right.
- Yes.

00:36:34.438 --> 00:36:36.740
And as we speak,

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.476
today's stock is completely sold out.

00:36:39.977 --> 00:36:41.178
Thank you.

00:36:48.418 --> 00:36:52.155
And this is how
my 41st birthday passes.

00:36:53.857 --> 00:36:55.659
When I was young,

00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:57.728
I thought I'd be living
quite splendidly by now.

00:36:59.096 --> 00:37:01.198
But why does it feel...

00:37:01.798 --> 00:37:05.102
like I'll end up old and small,
with nothing accomplished?

00:37:07.337 --> 00:37:09.840
(2025 Sweet Home Shopping
Not Career-interrupted Anymore)

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.142
(Home Shopping Reemployment Job Fair)

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.245
Mom, I need to pee.

00:37:15.245 --> 00:37:17.481
My little Min Jun.

00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:19.149
You didn't wet the bed and got up.

00:37:19.149 --> 00:37:20.851
Good job.

00:37:20.851 --> 00:37:23.186
Let's go to the bathroom.

00:37:23.186 --> 00:37:24.254
Good boy.

00:37:25.622 --> 00:37:26.490
Okay.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.194
But, Min Jun,

00:37:32.696 --> 00:37:36.500
why did you touch
that lady's butt earlier today?

00:37:38.669 --> 00:37:39.569
You know,

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.740
you can't touch other people's bodies...

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.841
without their permission.

00:37:45.776 --> 00:37:48.979
Let's not do that again, all right?

00:37:49.646 --> 00:37:52.349
I didn't touch her butt.

00:37:53.116 --> 00:37:54.851
I touched the strawberry.

00:37:55.619 --> 00:37:56.386
Strawberry?

00:37:56.887 --> 00:38:01.725
She had a strawberry on her bag.

00:38:01.725 --> 00:38:02.693
It was pretty.

00:38:04.227 --> 00:38:06.697
Mom, I drew a strawberry.

00:38:06.697 --> 00:38:08.131
Mom, I like strawberries.

00:38:08.131 --> 00:38:09.499
I like strawberries too.

00:38:12.903 --> 00:38:16.873
But the lady pushed me,
and I got this scrape.

00:38:18.742 --> 00:38:20.911
I see.

00:38:21.979 --> 00:38:23.680
I didn't even know that,

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.584
and I got mad at you more
because I was embarrassed.

00:38:27.584 --> 00:38:28.418
Sorry.

00:38:28.752 --> 00:38:30.520
What were you embarrassed about?

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.922
Were you embarrassed about me?

00:38:32.189 --> 00:38:34.558
No, that's not it.

00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:36.526
Me.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.228
I was embarrassed about myself.

00:38:39.196 --> 00:38:40.063
I'm sorry.

00:39:12.996 --> 00:39:13.897
Guys.

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:18.702
I wanted to say thank you
and sorry for today.

00:39:19.536 --> 00:39:22.673
I'd been so excited for days
to see you guys,

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.474
but I ruined everything.

00:39:25.575 --> 00:39:27.477
You know I love you guys
like crazy, right?

00:39:37.821 --> 00:39:39.189
Na Jeong.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.158
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:43.493
I was too harsh.

00:39:44.494 --> 00:39:47.164
I was twisted up
and got defensive for no reason.

00:39:48.598 --> 00:39:49.766
Actually,

00:39:50.901 --> 00:39:52.669
because I've been trying
for a baby lately...

00:39:52.669 --> 00:39:55.105
No, you were right.

00:39:55.105 --> 00:39:56.940
I pretended to be happy...

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.009
because I was scared.

00:39:59.009 --> 00:40:01.011
I snapped because I felt inferior.

00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:03.347
Honestly,

00:40:03.847 --> 00:40:05.616
I feel like I'll die
if I can't work again.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.821
But I didn't say it out loud
because I thought it'd make me feel worse.

00:40:11.655 --> 00:40:12.823
I lied to you all.

00:40:13.757 --> 00:40:15.158
Even to myself.

00:40:18.962 --> 00:40:20.764
Honey, I'll be there soon.

00:40:21.732 --> 00:40:22.566
Hurry.

00:40:26.203 --> 00:40:27.871
Then do it, girl.

00:40:27.871 --> 00:40:29.640
It looks like Min Woo
is all better now too.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.607
Why are you hesitating?

00:40:31.008 --> 00:40:32.676
It's honestly a waste
for someone as capable as you...

00:40:32.676 --> 00:40:34.578
to be living like that.

00:40:37.414 --> 00:40:38.282
You think so?

00:40:38.849 --> 00:40:40.183
You think I really should try again?

00:40:40.183 --> 00:40:41.151
Of course.

00:40:41.418 --> 00:40:42.452
Sure.

00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:46.056
But I'm already over 40.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.325
And I'm still worried about the kids.

00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:49.226
Look at you.

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:52.162
Who even thinks
so old-fashioned these days?

00:40:52.162 --> 00:40:54.898
They say now you should
multiply your age by 0.8.

00:40:54.898 --> 00:40:55.932
Then how old are we?

00:40:57.768 --> 00:40:58.935
We're 32.

00:41:01.171 --> 00:41:02.439
And someone said this too.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.409
Don't live feeling resentful.

00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:07.311
Live feeling sorry.

00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:56.159
How's your stomach?

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.461
I'm dying.

00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:01.598
Why did you have to drink
like there's no tomorrow?

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:06.336
Hey, honey.

00:42:06.336 --> 00:42:10.207
How would you feel
if I started working again?

00:42:10.207 --> 00:42:11.108
That's unexpected.

00:42:11.908 --> 00:42:12.976
What do you mean, unexpected?

00:42:12.976 --> 00:42:15.245
I told you yesterday
I wanted to work again.

00:42:15.245 --> 00:42:16.213
What kind of work?

00:42:16.213 --> 00:42:18.949
What kind?
Obviously, a show host.

00:42:20.317 --> 00:42:21.551
Will that even work now?

00:42:23.287 --> 00:42:24.154
Why not?

00:42:25.155 --> 00:42:27.658
Just because I took six years off,
you think I can't do it?

00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:30.761
I'm Cho Na Jeong
who used to pull in 4,000 per minute.

00:42:30.761 --> 00:42:32.429
- Don't you remember?
- Well,

00:42:32.429 --> 00:42:35.198
being a show host
while raising kids isn't easy.

00:42:35.198 --> 00:42:37.034
Wouldn't it be better
to find something else to do?

00:42:37.034 --> 00:42:39.436
Like what?
But being a show host is what I do best.

00:42:39.436 --> 00:42:41.705
I mean, I don't even have steady hours,

00:42:41.705 --> 00:42:44.007
and if you start an irregular job too,
what about the kids?

00:42:44.007 --> 00:42:45.242
We can hire a babysitter.

00:42:45.242 --> 00:42:47.811
Childcare systems are great these days.

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:50.781
Fine then, look into it if you want.

00:42:51.848 --> 00:42:54.117
Why do you sound so lukewarm about it?

00:42:57.621 --> 00:42:58.555
And honey.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:03.994
Next time you go out,
I promise to watch the kids.

00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:06.763
I'll go now.

00:43:07.664 --> 00:43:09.433
Bye.

00:43:14.771 --> 00:43:16.707
Hello, ma'am.

00:43:17.708 --> 00:43:20.777
I was going to call you
since the lease is ending soon.

00:43:22.279 --> 00:43:23.046
What?

00:43:24.014 --> 00:43:26.216
- Thank you.
- I'll get back to you.

00:43:26.216 --> 00:43:28.118
Yes, take care.

00:43:28.118 --> 00:43:29.019
You're here.

00:43:29.019 --> 00:43:31.588
The landlord said they wanted
to extend the contract last time.

00:43:31.588 --> 00:43:33.523
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:43:33.523 --> 00:43:36.059
They called in a rush yesterday...

00:43:36.059 --> 00:43:39.196
and said their son's getting married
and needs to move in right away.

00:43:39.196 --> 00:43:41.365
So they can't extend.

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:46.703
But finding a place in this area
won't be easy.

00:43:47.204 --> 00:43:49.506
You came in at such a low price,

00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:51.775
and now most are switching
to monthly rent.

00:43:52.843 --> 00:43:54.077
So what now?

00:43:54.344 --> 00:43:56.980
Should I check somewhere on the outskirts?

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.382
- The outskirts?
- Yes.

00:43:58.382 --> 00:43:59.883
No way.

00:43:59.883 --> 00:44:03.120
Could you please check...

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.888
if there are any good listing nearby?

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.393
You really worked hard today.

00:44:09.393 --> 00:44:11.094
Please let me know
if there's a good place.

00:44:11.094 --> 00:44:12.529
Don't worry.
Trust me.

00:44:12.529 --> 00:44:13.697
Okay, take care.

00:44:13.697 --> 00:44:15.299
- Thanks for the drink.
- Sure.

00:44:27.377 --> 00:44:29.379
I'm so frustrated.

00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:32.215
Why do housing prices nowadays
keep going up...

00:44:32.215 --> 00:44:34.151
beyond anyone's reach?

00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:37.354
So, there's really nowhere worth going?

00:44:37.354 --> 00:44:39.022
Nowhere.

00:44:39.022 --> 00:44:40.691
I was about to start working again,

00:44:40.691 --> 00:44:43.260
and now housing is tying me down.

00:44:44.861 --> 00:44:47.130
Is this a sign from heaven
to devote myself to home?

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.066
Don't be ridiculous.

00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:51.401
While you're at it,
do at least something.

00:44:51.401 --> 00:44:53.770
If you drift like this,
you'll hit 50 in no time,

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:56.206
and returning to work will really be over.

00:44:56.506 --> 00:44:58.675
You're at the cutoff age right now.

00:44:59.309 --> 00:45:00.877
I know that.

00:45:00.877 --> 00:45:03.780
But what do I do when I don't even
have a place to move to right now?

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.415
Rent monthly for now,

00:45:05.415 --> 00:45:06.717
get a job and earn money,

00:45:06.717 --> 00:45:09.086
then look for a place again.

00:45:09.086 --> 00:45:11.088
You need that kind of determination
if you want to work again.

00:45:12.422 --> 00:45:13.557
I don't know.

00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:17.127
Why is it so hard
to just say "Let's do that?"

00:45:19.429 --> 00:45:21.098
By the way, what about you?

00:45:21.098 --> 00:45:22.566
Did Eom Jong Do get back from Saipan?

00:45:22.766 --> 00:45:24.668
Yeah, he's back.

00:45:24.668 --> 00:45:25.769
What souvenir did he bring?

00:45:25.769 --> 00:45:28.739
Don't tell me some ridiculous
fridge magnet again.

00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:31.942
Who buys souvenirs these days
for going on a short business trip?

00:45:31.942 --> 00:45:32.876
Why not?

00:45:32.876 --> 00:45:34.911
You bring lots of gifts back
from business trips.

00:45:35.312 --> 00:45:38.482
Don't just let him mooch off you
just because you're older.

00:45:38.482 --> 00:45:39.883
You mooch off him too.

00:45:40.284 --> 00:45:42.653
That's why he treats you
like a walking wallet.

00:45:42.653 --> 00:45:44.921
I mooch too.

00:45:44.921 --> 00:45:46.790
What'd you mooch?

00:45:48.492 --> 00:45:51.228
Hey, the editor-in-chief wants me.

00:45:51.228 --> 00:45:52.329
I'll call you later.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:57.301
She always drops brutal truths
with a smile and riles me up.

00:46:00.737 --> 00:46:02.406
(Are you in Seoul?)

00:46:02.406 --> 00:46:04.608
Why's this brat ghosting my texts?

00:46:06.843 --> 00:46:08.345
Eom Jong Do's really changed.

00:46:09.012 --> 00:46:11.815
He used to wait by the phone
just for my calls.

00:46:16.053 --> 00:46:17.688
Why aren't you texting me?

00:46:18.522 --> 00:46:19.589
Are you that busy?

00:46:33.603 --> 00:46:36.840
(Why aren't you texting me?
Are you that busy?)

00:46:49.252 --> 00:46:50.320
((Ad) Silky hair)

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.421
(Summer Vacation Special Promotion)

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.961
Let's go with the flow.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.132
"Go with the flow?"
When did I ever not?

00:47:02.766 --> 00:47:03.634
Honey.

00:47:04.568 --> 00:47:05.402
Think about it.

00:47:06.236 --> 00:47:08.372
What do you think makes sense?
Living with the kids in a motel block,

00:47:08.372 --> 00:47:11.074
or paying 2,000 a month
when we can barely afford it?

00:47:11.074 --> 00:47:12.976
So if I start working again,

00:47:12.976 --> 00:47:15.812
it'll help with our finances too.
Two birds with one stone.

00:47:15.812 --> 00:47:17.648
To do that, we need a place nearby.

00:47:17.648 --> 00:47:20.584
In the middle of all this,
you're thinking about work?

00:47:20.584 --> 00:47:22.886
For now, putting out the fire first
is going with the flow.

00:47:23.353 --> 00:47:25.289
Do you know how old I am?

00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:26.523
If I drag my feet any longer,

00:47:26.523 --> 00:47:29.026
finding a job will really get hard.

00:47:29.026 --> 00:47:30.394
That's exactly my point.

00:47:31.828 --> 00:47:32.929
At your age,

00:47:32.929 --> 00:47:35.098
you think deciding to work
makes a job appear?

00:47:35.098 --> 00:47:36.366
Good grief.

00:47:36.366 --> 00:47:37.934
- Seriously?
- And to be blunt,

00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:39.469
even if we move,

00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:41.405
you can find some job you can do there.

00:47:41.405 --> 00:47:43.774
why be picky about doing
what you want at your age?

00:47:43.774 --> 00:47:44.541
Am I wrong?

00:47:45.809 --> 00:47:48.545
Anyway, don't take it too hard.

00:47:48.545 --> 00:47:50.080
We'll talk when I'm back. Bye.

00:47:51.348 --> 00:47:53.150
Right, and the braised tofu was good.

00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:58.455
What's wrong with my age?

00:48:12.636 --> 00:48:13.470
Hello?

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.838
Ms. Cho, where are you?

00:48:14.838 --> 00:48:16.974
There's a place for rent
in the complex at a cheap price.

00:48:16.974 --> 00:48:17.874
Really?

00:48:18.241 --> 00:48:20.444
Yes, ma'am. I'm on my way.

00:48:20.444 --> 00:48:23.013
I'm literally running now.
Please wait a bit.

00:48:23.013 --> 00:48:24.481
Yes, we're coming.

00:48:25.382 --> 00:48:27.918
They just came by
but haven't decided yet.

00:48:27.918 --> 00:48:29.219
Thank goodness.

00:48:29.219 --> 00:48:31.421
The owner has three homes.

00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:33.423
No loans, very clean.

00:48:33.957 --> 00:48:36.026
The previous tenant
suddenly had to go abroad,

00:48:36.026 --> 00:48:38.562
and will leave furniture
and appliances if needed.

00:48:38.562 --> 00:48:40.330
- Jackpot.
- Total jackpot.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.932
- Hurry, let's go check it out.
- Yes.

00:48:42.466 --> 00:48:45.168
I'm happy for you.
We have to hurry.

00:48:45.168 --> 00:48:46.970
Please wait.

00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:48.705
Thank you.

00:48:54.044 --> 00:48:55.312
What floor was it?

00:48:55.679 --> 00:48:56.847
Eleventh.

00:49:08.125 --> 00:49:10.093
Text the owner...

00:49:10.093 --> 00:49:11.895
that I'll wire the holding deposit
in ten minutes.

00:49:12.562 --> 00:49:14.531
When the door opens, run straight ahead.

00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:15.565
It's unit 1106.

00:49:15.565 --> 00:49:18.068
But they got on the elevator first.

00:49:18.368 --> 00:49:19.603
I feel bad about it.

00:49:21.038 --> 00:49:24.474
Our Father forgives the houseless.

00:49:24.474 --> 00:49:25.309
Good luck.

00:49:46.964 --> 00:49:49.266
- We got here first.
- It's not that way.

00:49:49.266 --> 00:49:51.268
It's not there. Come.

00:49:51.268 --> 00:49:53.003
It's not that way.
It's this way.

00:49:53.003 --> 00:49:54.471
- Hurry.
- Run.

00:49:56.707 --> 00:49:58.108
Faster.

00:49:58.108 --> 00:50:00.043
It's not there.

00:50:03.146 --> 00:50:04.414
Come on.

00:50:26.436 --> 00:50:27.838
Sorry.

00:50:27.838 --> 00:50:29.139
I pressed it first.

00:50:36.813 --> 00:50:39.016
How are you so fast?

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.085
You must've been athletic back in the day.

00:50:43.086 --> 00:50:45.889
I really hate losing, that's all.

00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:47.291
Me too.

00:50:47.291 --> 00:50:49.726
When I saw that lady earlier...

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.062
She's here.

00:50:53.263 --> 00:50:54.798
Say hello.
She's the owner of the house.

00:50:54.798 --> 00:50:55.932
Hello.

00:50:55.932 --> 00:50:57.734
- Ma'am, could I get a glass of water?
- Sure.

00:50:59.569 --> 00:51:01.672
Once I said I'd sign with you,

00:51:01.672 --> 00:51:04.341
every real estate office
kept calling nonstop.

00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:07.577
It makes me think
I should switch to monthly next time.

00:51:07.577 --> 00:51:10.747
Don't say that.

00:51:10.747 --> 00:51:13.083
You'll scare the tenant.

00:51:14.351 --> 00:51:15.652
Cheer up.

00:51:15.652 --> 00:51:19.256
She doesn't change her mind easily.

00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:31.702
Jjon Na Jeong?

00:51:35.872 --> 00:51:39.209
You used to live in Hanmae-dong.

00:51:39.476 --> 00:51:40.877
You're Cho Na Jeong, aren't you?

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:43.113
Yes.

00:51:44.581 --> 00:51:46.783
It's me, Mi Sook.

00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:49.152
Yang Mi Sook.

00:51:54.691 --> 00:51:56.159
(Cho Na Jeong)

00:51:56.159 --> 00:51:58.061
Yang Mi Sook, anywhere you want to go?

00:51:58.061 --> 00:51:59.396
How about a karaoke?

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:02.332
There's a karaoke right up front.
Should we go there?

00:52:02.332 --> 00:52:03.233
Hey.

00:52:03.934 --> 00:52:05.135
Why are you ignoring me?

00:52:05.802 --> 00:52:07.704
I didn't see you, so what?

00:52:08.505 --> 00:52:09.640
Bullshit.

00:52:10.874 --> 00:52:11.742
Who's that?

00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:14.778
Her? The class president.

00:52:15.579 --> 00:52:17.848
She grinds alone to succeed
and studies like a maniac.

00:52:17.848 --> 00:52:18.849
She's ruthless.

00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:21.685
But she's kind of cute.

00:52:22.352 --> 00:52:24.655
You crazy bastard,
are you out of your mind?

00:52:24.655 --> 00:52:26.390
Fine. Just find someone
so we can pair off.

00:52:27.224 --> 00:52:28.292
Hey, Jjon Na Jeong.

00:52:28.725 --> 00:52:31.161
Since we're unpaired right now,

00:52:31.428 --> 00:52:33.664
how about hitting a karaoke
for just two hours?

00:52:36.266 --> 00:52:37.067
And of course,

00:52:37.801 --> 00:52:38.935
you're paying.

00:52:40.304 --> 00:52:43.206
Does your mom know
this is what you're doing?

00:52:43.206 --> 00:52:44.341
What?

00:52:44.341 --> 00:52:47.010
I was in the teachers' office last time,

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.246
and your mom was bawling
in front of our homeroom teacher.

00:52:49.846 --> 00:52:53.016
Yang Mi Sook, we're almost in high school.

00:52:53.016 --> 00:52:55.052
How long are you going to keep
wasting time like this?

00:52:55.052 --> 00:52:56.253
What are you going to do with your life?

00:52:56.253 --> 00:52:58.488
You crazy bitch.
Who are you to lecture me?

00:52:58.488 --> 00:52:59.356
Let go.

00:52:59.356 --> 00:53:01.358
- Let go!
- Stop it.

00:53:01.358 --> 00:53:02.626
You let go first.

00:53:02.626 --> 00:53:03.860
- You first.
- I said let go.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.162
Stop it.

00:53:05.162 --> 00:53:07.297
- I said let go.
- You first.

00:53:09.399 --> 00:53:12.736
Small world, right, Na Jeong?

00:53:12.736 --> 00:53:14.838
Yes, tell me about it.

00:53:15.505 --> 00:53:17.107
How have you been all this time?

00:53:17.107 --> 00:53:19.810
I think I vaguely heard
you went to Yeonhee University.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:20.978
I did.

00:53:21.845 --> 00:53:23.013
Are you married?

00:53:23.547 --> 00:53:24.281
Yes.

00:53:24.281 --> 00:53:25.248
Kids?

00:53:25.515 --> 00:53:26.383
Two.

00:53:26.717 --> 00:53:27.951
Daughters? Sons?

00:53:28.251 --> 00:53:29.386
Two sons.

00:53:32.356 --> 00:53:33.523
Are they well-behaved?

00:53:34.157 --> 00:53:36.393
Boys tend to be rough on the house.

00:53:37.294 --> 00:53:40.397
No. My kids are super calm.

00:53:40.397 --> 00:53:43.066
The downstairs neighbor even asked
if we had kids at all.

00:53:43.066 --> 00:53:44.801
"I thought you didn't have any kids."

00:53:44.801 --> 00:53:46.603
They were shocked and even said this.

00:53:54.044 --> 00:53:54.878
Hey.

00:53:55.112 --> 00:53:57.381
What kind of business did you do...

00:53:57.381 --> 00:53:58.982
to get that rich?

00:53:58.982 --> 00:54:01.418
I heard from the real estate agent
that you own three houses.

00:54:01.418 --> 00:54:02.619
That's amazing.

00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:07.357
I quit school in senior year...

00:54:07.357 --> 00:54:08.825
and went to Australia to study.

00:54:09.026 --> 00:54:12.095
When I came back to Korea,
I started working in Dongdaemun.

00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:15.198
When the live-commerce era began,
it was like I'd found my wave.

00:54:15.198 --> 00:54:16.667
I started selling clothes
through live streams,

00:54:16.667 --> 00:54:19.303
expanded the business, and that took off.

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.637
Hey.

00:54:20.837 --> 00:54:22.039
Hey.

00:54:25.108 --> 00:54:27.144
Do you know what they call this?

00:54:29.012 --> 00:54:31.214
Ladies, no other shop has this.

00:54:31.214 --> 00:54:33.750
Look. If you order right now, I'll...

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.986
A mobile show host.

00:54:37.854 --> 00:54:40.257
They say life's full of downs and ups.

00:54:42.125 --> 00:54:44.161
But you know, I always had that in me.

00:54:44.761 --> 00:54:47.931
The pioneering spirit
to take paths others wouldn't.

00:54:47.931 --> 00:54:49.967
The nerve and confidence...

00:54:49.967 --> 00:54:53.003
to say "no" when others said "yes."

00:54:56.873 --> 00:54:57.874
What about you?

00:54:58.175 --> 00:54:59.810
Aren't you working?

00:55:00.544 --> 00:55:01.411
No.

00:55:02.212 --> 00:55:03.380
Right.

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.649
At our age, working's not easy.

00:55:06.383 --> 00:55:08.485
That's true.

00:55:08.485 --> 00:55:09.486
My gosh.

00:55:09.486 --> 00:55:11.622
Weren't you on JBN News recently?

00:55:11.622 --> 00:55:13.657
Some fair for women
with career breaks or something.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.196
You saw it.

00:55:19.196 --> 00:55:20.364
Hey.

00:55:20.631 --> 00:55:23.200
I thought, "Isn't that Cho Na Jeong?"
but wasn't sure.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.267
But it was you.

00:55:24.267 --> 00:55:26.236
The woman who said
she wanted to work again.

00:55:31.608 --> 00:55:32.676
How'd she see that?

00:55:33.543 --> 00:55:35.479
Hey, perfect timing.

00:55:35.479 --> 00:55:37.247
You said you're looking for a job, right?

00:55:37.247 --> 00:55:38.382
I actually need someone.

00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:39.916
No, it's fine, Mi Sook.

00:55:40.884 --> 00:55:42.052
Fine? What's fine?

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.188
Didn't you say you're job-hunting?

00:55:45.188 --> 00:55:47.424
Does it hurt your pride to work under me?

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.329
You still have that way
of getting under people's skin.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.733
Hey, you won't get anywhere
if you keep being so complacent.

00:55:56.733 --> 00:55:58.135
No matter how successful you were before,

00:55:58.135 --> 00:56:01.004
you're just a housewife
rotting away at home now.

00:56:01.605 --> 00:56:03.807
Honestly, women who only
raise kids at home...

00:56:03.807 --> 00:56:05.542
don't even get chances like this.

00:56:07.077 --> 00:56:09.746
This is why it's so hard
to talk to stay-at-home moms.

00:56:09.746 --> 00:56:12.616
No, it's not that, Mi Sook.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:16.186
I already got another offer
to work with someone else,

00:56:16.186 --> 00:56:17.688
that's why I can't.

00:56:17.688 --> 00:56:19.423
Don't get me wrong.

00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:25.095
I wasn't going to say this
because I didn't want to sound braggy.

00:56:25.095 --> 00:56:27.731
It would be ridiculous to say this myself.

00:56:28.265 --> 00:56:31.168
But I used to be a show host too,
who pulled in 4,000 a minute.

00:56:31.168 --> 00:56:33.770
So when my face popped up on TV,

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:37.207
my phone started blowing up
with calls from everywhere.

00:56:37.207 --> 00:56:40.310
So I took a job offer.

00:56:43.246 --> 00:56:44.047
Really?

00:56:46.016 --> 00:56:46.850
From where?

00:56:47.985 --> 00:56:49.186
Sweet Home Shopping.

00:56:51.788 --> 00:56:53.256
Sweet Home Shopping?

00:57:07.004 --> 00:57:08.105
(2005
Na Jeong's Birthday 1)

00:57:08.105 --> 00:57:11.375
I decided I wouldn't live
like the other ladies.

00:57:12.809 --> 00:57:14.778
Even when I grow up,

00:57:15.679 --> 00:57:17.848
I'll never live like other wives.

00:57:18.682 --> 00:57:19.449
Because...

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:21.752
I was born fabulous.

00:57:23.353 --> 00:57:24.488
I'm young,

00:57:25.222 --> 00:57:26.056
I'm strong,

00:57:27.024 --> 00:57:28.959
and I'm living in the middle
of a grand adventure.

00:57:30.661 --> 00:57:33.363
You can't live complaining all day.

00:57:33.997 --> 00:57:34.865
Wait.

00:57:37.534 --> 00:57:38.535
Naraeng.

00:57:38.802 --> 00:57:39.536
Yes?

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:41.338
I think...

00:57:41.905 --> 00:57:44.107
maybe you should try again next time.

00:57:46.176 --> 00:57:48.345
What do you mean, Director?

00:57:48.345 --> 00:57:50.314
If you go onstage like this now,

00:57:50.314 --> 00:57:52.649
the other actors will chew us out alive.

00:57:52.649 --> 00:57:54.551
I wasn't good enough.
Please give me another chance.

00:57:54.551 --> 00:57:55.719
I can really pull this off.

00:57:55.719 --> 00:57:58.355
How can you just fire me
without even a warning?

00:57:58.355 --> 00:57:59.690
Everyone, come out now.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:04.594
- I have to do this, please.
- Happy birthday to you

00:58:05.295 --> 00:58:09.232
Happy birthday to you

00:58:09.232 --> 00:58:13.737
Happy birthday, dear Cho Naraeng

00:58:13.737 --> 00:58:17.007
Happy birthday to you

00:58:23.013 --> 00:58:24.448
Blow out the candles first.

00:58:24.448 --> 00:58:25.882
One, two, three.

00:58:31.622 --> 00:58:32.823
The final event.

00:59:37.854 --> 00:59:39.790
(Don't call me ma'am)

00:59:40.023 --> 00:59:41.625
I might become a total fraud.

00:59:42.092 --> 00:59:44.027
Don't you want to go back
to Sweet Home Shopping?

00:59:44.027 --> 00:59:45.462
Should I try applying there once more?

00:59:45.462 --> 00:59:47.998
Why would you go there?
Who'd welcome you?

00:59:47.998 --> 00:59:49.466
Do you not find me attractive anymore?

00:59:49.466 --> 00:59:51.635
Sorry, but I feel sick.

00:59:51.635 --> 00:59:52.703
Let's end this.

00:59:53.937 --> 00:59:55.639
I must've been insane.

00:59:55.639 --> 00:59:56.840
Totally insane.

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.775
I told you to apply somewhere else,
not Sweet Home Shopping.

00:59:58.775 --> 01:00:01.278
Why exactly can't I apply there?

01:00:01.478 --> 01:00:03.547
It seems the interview date got moved.

01:00:04.114 --> 01:00:05.515
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

01:00:05.515 --> 01:00:07.484
The competition's so fierce.

01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.052
Jjon Na Jeong?

01:00:12.756 --> 01:00:14.758
