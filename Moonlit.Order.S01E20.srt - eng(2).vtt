You've been hugging all night.

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:08.715
Enough now!

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:09.796
Shut up.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:10.835
If you're jealous,

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:11.875
go find a woman.

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:17.675
Xue Youshou,

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.036
or rather, the real Xue Hexu.

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:22.196
He's known everything from the start.

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:23.316
This shows his cunning

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:24.555
is beyond our calculations.

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:26.636
He's colluding with Grand Tutor Zhou,

00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:28.395
planning something evil.

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:30.184
I also discovered You...

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:33.796
He colludes with imperial chefs

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:35.240
to poison the Emperor.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.395
I bet Grand Tutor Zhou
is behind all this.

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:42.196
Xue Youshou stole my identity,

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:43.395
deceiving Emperor Jia.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:44.995
And Grand Tutor Zhou

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:47.076
knew I am the former Crown Prince,

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:49.076
yet attempted to kill me secretly,

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:51.304
even forged
the bone-portrait identification.

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:52.796
They deceived Emperor Jia

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:53.916
and poisoned him.

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:55.715
Once Emperor Jia dies,

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:57.435
their goal

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.036
will be the throne.

00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:01.155
After His Majesty's gone,

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:03.036
Grand Tutor Zhou will announce

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:05.316
Xue Youshou as the true Crown Prince.

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:07.756
Xue Youshou's ascension

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:09.275
would be legitimate.

00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:12.796
We can't let his scheme succeed.

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:13.995
We must stop him.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:14.835
Will you?

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:18.196
Their mutual destruction

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:19.875
is exactly what you want.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:21.196
Gu Qianfu.

00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:22.916
What do you mean?

00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:25.800
Emperor Jia wanted your life,

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:28.076
and Xue Youshou stole your identity,

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:30.995
even nearly took the woman you love.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:32.916
You must hate them deeply.

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.236
If I were you,

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:43.636
I'd let Xue Youshou kill the Emperor

00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:45.875
before revealing my true identity.

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:48.356
Two birds with one stone.

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:52.636
I have no idea.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:55.916
I can't think clearly.

00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:58.956
(He suffered greatly)

00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:00.155
(and lost his memory.)

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:02.516
(Finally, he found peace here,)

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:05.356
(yet got hunted by me and Gu Qianfu.)

00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:07.395
(At this moment,)

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:08.916
(if even I pressure him,)

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:11.236
(he'll have no one left to trust.)

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:20.155
If you have no idea,

00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:21.235
then drop it.

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:23.556
Whatever you choose,

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:25.076
I'll support you.

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:30.715
Feng.

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:32.436
Thank you.

He's right.

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:03.795
Go with Gu Qianfu first.

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:05.915
Alright.

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:09.956
Let's go. Stop it.

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.595
(I must stop
Xue Youshou's poisoning first.)

00:05:55.676 --> 00:05:56.196
Freeze!

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:00.436
Miss Feng.

00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:02.395
What are you doing?

00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:13.676
Your Majesty.

00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:16.355
Fortunately, I discovered this in time

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.395
to prevent Feng Zuoren's scheme.

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:21.436
Feng Zuoren
has long plotted against you,

00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:23.516
colluding with the Xue family to rebel.

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:26.076
You are wasting time

00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:27.516
framing me and the Xue family,

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.116
but should've investigated

00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:30.756
why His Majesty's health declines

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:32.956
despite prolonged treatment.

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:35.035
These herbs came from the Xue family.

00:06:35.556 --> 00:06:36.516
Did imperial physicians

00:06:37.275 --> 00:06:38.516
check the previous medicines?

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:39.915
Your Majesty,

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:41.475
Imperial physicians confirmed

00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:44.076
the medicines aren't tainted.

00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:44.876
However...

00:06:45.436 --> 00:06:46.516
What?

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:47.756
The medicines

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:49.316
aren't tainted,

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.595
but your pulse shows abnormalities.

00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:53.155
This is unbelievable.

00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:54.595
A patient's pulse

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:55.835
surely shows abnormalities.

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:56.835
The medicines

00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:58.035
were made

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.035
of Western herbs
prepared by the Xue family.

00:07:00.355 --> 00:07:01.035
In my opinion,

00:07:01.436 --> 00:07:03.035
the Xue family might be likely

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.475
harboring Crown Prince Jia Xun

00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:06.915
and plotting rebellion.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:09.556
They tampered with the herbs

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:11.035
to poison you.

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:13.436
False accusations!

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:15.235
The Xue family

00:07:16.155 --> 00:07:18.035
dares to be this audacious?

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:19.436
Your Majesty,

00:07:20.035 --> 00:07:21.035
Feng Zuoren

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:23.035
has married into the Xue family.

00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:24.676
At first,

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:26.996
you assigned her
to monitor the Xue family,

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:29.436
yet now she defends the Xue family.

00:07:29.676 --> 00:07:31.355
She must be bribed by the Xue family

00:07:31.556 --> 00:07:32.756
to conspire in rebellion!

00:07:33.756 --> 00:07:34.035
I...

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:35.915
Your Majesty.

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:14.116
(Oh, no!)

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:21.076
Your Majesty,

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:24.076
look what it is.

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:38.396
Your Majesty,

00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:41.115
these are the same Western herbs
from the Xue family.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:42.875
This monster

00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:44.755
has been poisoning you.

00:08:47.556 --> 00:08:49.436
(That sachet was part of his scheme.)

00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:52.556
I noticed you've been feeling restless.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.355
I put some calming herbs in here.

00:08:55.956 --> 00:08:56.715
Wear it

00:08:57.835 --> 00:08:58.676
to ease your mind.

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:02.076
Thank you.

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:07.875
(I told you)

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:09.916
(whether she's willing or not,)

00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.156
(she'll help us.)

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:21.556
Evil shall not taint the imperial body!

00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:23.235
Traitor!

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:25.276
Do you admit your crimes?

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.196
Issue my imperial decree,

00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:32.316
strip Feng Zuoren
of Xue Guardian command.

00:09:33.355 --> 00:09:34.196
Jing'an Bureau

00:09:35.036 --> 00:09:37.156
assumes control of Xue Guardian.

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:40.316
Take Feng Zuoren

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:41.595
and

00:09:42.595 --> 00:09:44.076
the Xue family to the prison,

00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:45.956
awaiting judgment.

00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:19.556
What's wrong?

00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:21.995
Anything to say?

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:25.355
Lord Xue.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:29.156
Feng Zuoren,

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.355
want to defy the Emperor?

00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:33.396
Lord Xue has led us for years,

00:10:33.475 --> 00:10:34.316
devoted and upright.

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:35.835
She remains our exemplar.

00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:38.316
If anyone dares frame her

00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:38.956
and arrest her,

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:40.715
we won't comply.

00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:42.076
Warn the Xue family now

00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:43.436
things are bad

00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:45.515
and they're wanted now.

00:10:45.715 --> 00:10:46.475
Yes, my lord.

00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:54.076
You frame me

00:10:54.515 --> 00:10:56.156
and the Xue family for rebellion.

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.196
Now I'll purge treacherous ministers

00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:00.956
to protect His Majesty

00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:02.676
from further deception.

00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:05.835
Only Grand Tutor Zhou bears guilt.

00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:07.235
The rest of you,

00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:08.956
stop protecting him.

00:11:22.956 --> 00:11:23.956
Feng Zuoren, how dare you

00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:26.076
twist truth here?

00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:28.036
Don't heed her nonsense!

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:29.676
By imperial decree,

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:31.475
the one

00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:33.755
who captures Feng Zuoren gets promotion.

00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:36.916
Xue Guardian, listen!

00:11:37.276 --> 00:11:37.635
Yes!

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:38.676
Secure the perimeter.

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:40.396
I'll claim Grand Tutor's head.

00:11:41.156 --> 00:11:41.595
Yes.

00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:49.475
Why...

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.595
Why fear her?

00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:54.316
Xue Guardian,

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:56.076
do you defy the Emperor?

00:12:05.835 --> 00:12:06.355
Hold on.

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:07.916
(Wait.)

00:12:08.715 --> 00:12:10.316
(If we resist now,)

00:12:10.755 --> 00:12:11.875
(it'd confirm my charges)

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:14.355
(and implicate everyone,)

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.316
(leaving the Emperor unprotected.)

00:12:16.995 --> 00:12:17.755
(This is a trap.)

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:18.956
(I can't kill him.)

00:12:20.436 --> 00:12:21.475
I've changed my mind.

00:12:22.196 --> 00:12:23.036
I'll go with you.

00:12:24.475 --> 00:12:25.276
Xue Guardian.

00:12:26.396 --> 00:12:27.276
During my absence,

00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:29.556
Jing'an Bureau
will take over Xue Guardian.

00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:31.635
Once everything is clarified,

00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:33.436
I'll be released.

00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:50.956
Take her.

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:04.556
Search!

00:13:11.867 --> 00:13:13.212
(Xue Mansion)

00:13:24.556 --> 00:13:25.916
He got away.

00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:27.076
Let's go

00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:28.515
tell Grand Tutor.

00:13:28.515 --> 00:13:28.916
Go!

00:13:32.715 --> 00:13:33.355
Lord Dingyuan,

00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:34.436
it's been a while.

00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:37.156
I've come

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:39.316
for the Xue family's treason.

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:41.916
By imperial decree,

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:43.635
I need to arrest you all

00:13:44.475 --> 00:13:47.076
for investigation, nothing personal.

00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:19.076
(No. I'm late.)

00:14:24.556 --> 00:14:26.276
Reveal the traitor's whereabouts,

00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:28.956
and I'll grant you an intact corpse.

00:14:35.115 --> 00:14:36.956
The traitor is right before me.

00:14:40.916 --> 00:14:42.076
Still making

00:14:42.235 --> 00:14:42.875
stubborn talk.

00:14:43.475 --> 00:14:43.995
Beat her.

00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:44.755
Yes!

00:14:54.115 --> 00:14:54.796
Xue Fugui!

00:14:58.115 --> 00:14:59.835
You've harbored a traitor for years.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.715
Your entire family are imprisoned,
yet you show no remorse.

00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:03.956
Tell me,

00:15:04.715 --> 00:15:06.396
where's Xue Hexu?

00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:08.355
Villain! Release my stepmother!

00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:09.956
You've already killed Hexu!

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.276
Don't try to hurt my family.

00:15:11.916 --> 00:15:12.835
Stepmother?

00:15:14.556 --> 00:15:15.355
Do you know

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:17.076
how many times

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:18.916
she puts your entire family in danger?

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.956
She's a bloodthirsty monster!

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:23.156
What?

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.316
What?

00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:26.036
Let her tell you herself.

00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:27.316
How many times has she

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:29.316
tried to destroy your Xue family?

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:30.556
Poisoning,

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:32.115
arson,

00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:33.316
blade executions?

00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:34.715
You're right.

00:15:35.355 --> 00:15:36.076
Bring her here.

00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:44.595
Go inside.

00:15:51.556 --> 00:15:52.235
Great!

00:15:52.635 --> 00:15:53.235
Stepmother is here,

00:15:53.316 --> 00:15:54.316
she'll protect us.

00:15:54.835 --> 00:15:55.676
I'm not scared now.

00:15:56.076 --> 00:15:56.556
Stepmother,

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.276
is what that bad man

00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:00.076
said true?

00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:03.396
Everyone,

00:16:03.715 --> 00:16:06.115
salute the Xue Guardian Commander,

00:16:06.355 --> 00:16:09.436
Miss Feng Zuoren.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.396
My lord, you...

00:16:13.715 --> 00:16:15.316
Miss Feng,

00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:19.115
you're well-known
throughout the court and beyond.

00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:20.515
Xue Guardian?

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.115
The storybooks say

00:16:23.436 --> 00:16:26.635
it's a ruthless spy agency.

00:16:27.156 --> 00:16:28.875
They dismember, behead,

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:30.635
draw-and-quarter,

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:32.076
skin alive,

00:16:32.676 --> 00:16:33.396
brand with irons,

00:16:34.156 --> 00:16:34.835
castrate...

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:36.995
Resort to cruelty.

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:37.875
Stop that!

00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:39.556
So Miss Feng,

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:41.196
do you intend to kill us?

00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:47.875
(Let the internal strife begin.)

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.595
(Whether Feng Zuoren
destroys the Xue family,)

00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:52.396
(or the Xue family kills her,)

00:16:53.276 --> 00:16:55.995
(both outcomes benefit me.)

00:16:56.676 --> 00:16:58.396
(As for that traitor Xue Hexu,)

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:00.755
(he's alone)

00:17:01.115 --> 00:17:03.036
(and powerless to do anything big.)

00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:09.156
The Emperor sent me to you

00:17:09.916 --> 00:17:10.916
to figure out

00:17:11.396 --> 00:17:13.315
if you harbor the former Crown Prince.

00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:14.755
After that, I was told

00:17:16.515 --> 00:17:17.436
to eliminate you all.

00:17:25.035 --> 00:17:26.596
But during my time with you,

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:28.876
I experienced

00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:30.596
a family warmth I've never known.

00:17:32.356 --> 00:17:33.956
That's why I hesitated.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.715
Until I discovered
the former Crown Prince's portrait

00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:42.075
and the ledger.

00:17:43.636 --> 00:17:44.275
I realized

00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:47.116
the day I uncovered the truth

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:50.315
would be your doom.

00:18:02.676 --> 00:18:04.436
But you showed me

00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:06.515
care and kindness.

00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:11.916
It'd make me a monster

00:18:13.636 --> 00:18:14.995
to harm my family.

00:18:17.715 --> 00:18:18.636
Move!

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:21.795
Hey, you!

00:18:23.315 --> 00:18:24.235
Feng Zuoren.

00:18:25.636 --> 00:18:27.116
When you married into the Xue family,

00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:29.836
you kept claiming we were one family.

00:18:31.156 --> 00:18:33.035
Is this how you treat family?

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:54.676
Holding such a huge secret
in your heart,

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:57.075
with no one to confide in.

00:18:58.156 --> 00:18:58.876
Child,

00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:01.396
you must've suffered greatly.

00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:06.755
Since you've been honest with us,

00:19:07.356 --> 00:19:09.196
then we are truly family.

00:19:09.876 --> 00:19:10.396
Fear not.

00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:13.555
We can always figure out a solution.

00:19:16.035 --> 00:19:17.035
Exactly.

00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:19.156
At worst,

00:19:19.676 --> 00:19:21.755
just sacrifice
another Xue family member.

00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:24.795
Father.

00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:27.156
Who will you sacrifice this time?

00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:28.876
Dongyang?

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:30.156
Nuannuan?

00:19:31.396 --> 00:19:32.956
Grandmother maybe?

00:19:33.075 --> 00:19:33.676
Youshou,

00:19:34.196 --> 00:19:35.315
you ingrate!

00:19:36.035 --> 00:19:37.795
What do you want

00:19:38.116 --> 00:19:39.475
from us?

00:19:39.836 --> 00:19:40.995
I wonder

00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:44.396
when I fell into the water at seven,

00:19:45.555 --> 00:19:47.436
why you didn't save me?

00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:51.196
(Back then, I accidentally)

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.836
(pushed that traitor into the water.)

00:19:53.555 --> 00:19:54.876
(I tried to save him,)

00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:56.836
(and fell in myself.)

00:19:58.315 --> 00:19:59.715
(Yet you focused on rescuing him)

00:20:00.555 --> 00:20:02.035
(and ignored me.)

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.995
(I'm your real son.)

00:20:05.596 --> 00:20:06.636
(Yet you let him)

00:20:06.636 --> 00:20:08.475
(steal even my name!)

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:11.196
All this is fate.

00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:13.356
Since you stole his jade pendant,

00:20:14.315 --> 00:20:14.836
from now on,

00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:17.035
it'll belong to you.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:18.315
His identity

00:20:19.116 --> 00:20:19.916
will be also yours.

00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:22.436
Just go.

00:20:23.596 --> 00:20:24.515
No!

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:25.836
Father,

00:20:26.396 --> 00:20:27.596
don't drive me away!

00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:30.156
I'll return his jade pendant.

00:20:30.636 --> 00:20:33.035
I'll repay him a-thousand-fold.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.235
This pains me too,

00:20:40.075 --> 00:20:40.636
but...

00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:46.956
Perhaps

00:20:48.995 --> 00:20:50.235
this is fate.

00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:54.235
I'll send an old subordinate

00:20:54.916 --> 00:20:56.116
to accompany you south.

00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:57.636
You'll have

00:20:58.275 --> 00:20:59.995
protection and provisions.

00:21:01.436 --> 00:21:02.475
You want

00:21:02.916 --> 00:21:04.396
to go to the south with me, right?

00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:06.356
Now is your chance.

00:21:10.475 --> 00:21:11.555
No, Father.

00:21:12.196 --> 00:21:13.436
Don't drive me away.

00:21:14.035 --> 00:21:15.636
I was wrong.

00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:17.795
Father.

00:21:24.755 --> 00:21:25.315
From now on,

00:21:26.836 --> 00:21:27.916
don't call me Father.

00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:30.035
Take him away.

00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:30.636
Yes.

00:21:32.315 --> 00:21:32.995
Father!

00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:34.636
Father, no!

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:35.596
Father!

00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:37.396
Father!

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:39.755
Father!

00:21:43.555 --> 00:21:44.075
Father,

00:21:45.515 --> 00:21:47.275
I'm your real son!

00:21:48.116 --> 00:21:49.075
All these years,

00:21:49.956 --> 00:21:51.315
to protect Xue Hexu,

00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:54.035
you sacrificed me?

00:21:55.555 --> 00:21:56.356
Why?

00:21:57.436 --> 00:21:58.916
Why me?

00:21:59.515 --> 00:22:01.596
You sent me to the south.

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:05.596
I've been alone since childhood,

00:22:07.396 --> 00:22:08.315
yet you still

00:22:09.636 --> 00:22:11.636
don't know why I treat you like this.

00:22:12.596 --> 00:22:14.876
I wonder why you did it to me.

00:22:15.515 --> 00:22:16.876
Because of you

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.396
and your blind loyalty
to the late Empress.

00:22:20.636 --> 00:22:22.555
To protect her son,

00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:23.956
Jia Xun.

00:22:25.436 --> 00:22:25.916
Father,

00:22:27.436 --> 00:22:30.235
I'm the real Xue Hexu.

00:22:31.075 --> 00:22:34.035
Jia Xun should've lived in hiding,

00:22:34.995 --> 00:22:36.795
yet he's living carefree.

00:22:37.275 --> 00:22:38.035
While I

00:22:38.956 --> 00:22:40.676
must conceal my identity.

00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:44.555
I lost my name at seven.

00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:48.515
I've been

00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:51.436
all alone all these years!

00:22:52.636 --> 00:22:53.636
What do you mean?

00:22:54.275 --> 00:22:55.876
You're Hexu?

00:22:56.315 --> 00:22:57.636
Hexu is not that

00:22:58.196 --> 00:22:58.956
rude,

00:22:59.436 --> 00:22:59.956
and arrogant.

00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:03.555
Dongyang,

00:23:04.755 --> 00:23:05.356
Nuannuan.

00:23:06.956 --> 00:23:08.116
Don't you recognize me?

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:10.436
I'm Hexu.

00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:12.755
We used to

00:23:12.836 --> 00:23:14.216
play together when we were kids.

00:23:14.836 --> 00:23:17.075
Didn't you two love me most?

00:23:19.396 --> 00:23:20.956
Take a good look at me.

00:23:22.196 --> 00:23:24.836
That Xue Hexu is an impostor!

00:23:32.676 --> 00:23:33.235
What?

00:23:34.436 --> 00:23:35.475
You don't believe me?

00:23:36.876 --> 00:23:38.156
Ask Father then.

00:23:38.715 --> 00:23:40.795
He swapped me with the fake Xue Hexu

00:23:41.235 --> 00:23:43.356
when I was seven.

00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:45.116
It made us all to reunite

00:23:45.235 --> 00:23:47.636
in this prison today.

00:23:48.956 --> 00:23:50.995
This is all

00:23:52.275 --> 00:23:53.235
your fault!

00:23:54.596 --> 00:23:55.916
It's all your fault,

00:23:57.156 --> 00:23:58.515
Xue Fugui.

00:24:13.315 --> 00:24:14.836
You're my grandson.

00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:17.356
I recognize you.

00:24:18.315 --> 00:24:19.156
Youshou.

00:24:20.156 --> 00:24:22.555
When you came to Xue Mansion
to exorcise evil forces,

00:24:23.235 --> 00:24:26.436
you promised to protect the Xue family.

00:24:27.555 --> 00:24:30.315
Is this how you protect us?

00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:33.196
You told me to wait,

00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:37.755
only for our whole family
to end up imprisoned!

00:24:38.396 --> 00:24:40.196
What do you want?

00:24:44.836 --> 00:24:46.156
What do I want?

00:24:47.636 --> 00:24:49.075
What do I want?

00:24:51.795 --> 00:24:52.676
Since everyone

00:24:52.755 --> 00:24:54.636
believes I'm the former Crown Prince,

00:24:55.676 --> 00:24:56.356
fine!

00:24:57.396 --> 00:24:58.916
Why shouldn't I play along?

00:25:00.356 --> 00:25:02.235
If Emperor Jia Ji can rule,

00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:04.596
then I, Jia Xun,

00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:08.035
can do it too!

00:25:09.755 --> 00:25:10.636
Jia Xun?

00:25:10.995 --> 00:25:11.636
Youshou.

00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:13.555
You ingrate!

00:25:14.075 --> 00:25:15.436
This is treason!

00:25:16.035 --> 00:25:17.436
This is rebellion!

00:25:18.156 --> 00:25:18.755
Father,

00:25:19.596 --> 00:25:20.876
don't be anxious.

00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:23.596
Once I become emperor,

00:25:24.436 --> 00:25:26.715
I won't have to hide anymore.

00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:28.235
And our Xue family

00:25:28.836 --> 00:25:30.876
won't have to live in fear either.

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:33.235
I'm doing this for you all.

00:25:33.755 --> 00:25:35.636
How can this be rebellion?

00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:39.636
So you've been involved all along,

00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:42.035
hiding your true identity
from the start,

00:25:42.596 --> 00:25:44.436
and using my gratitude
towards Young Master?

00:25:45.356 --> 00:25:46.075
You're

00:25:46.116 --> 00:25:48.676
a monster with hands
drenched in carnage.

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:52.075
And you fantasize about
others fighting for your affection?

00:25:58.555 --> 00:26:01.315
Go be a couple with Xue Hexu

00:26:02.475 --> 00:26:04.715
