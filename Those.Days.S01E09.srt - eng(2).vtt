You're making lunch?

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:50.499
You're back.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.820
Zhixia.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.219
Zhixia.

How's your copy writing
for Rufeng Liquor?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.340
I've finished writing it.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.250
Let me have a look.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.950
I've shared it with you.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.740
Is it terrible?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.659
Not really,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.340
it's a disaster.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.099
Tell me where I can improve then.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.219
I better amend it myself.

Today's my aunt's 40th birthday.
I want...

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.650
You want to apply for leave again?

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.460
Go ahead.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.340
Thank you!

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.950
I'll get going then.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.219
All the best!

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.499
Bye.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.660
This counts
as coming in late and leaving early.

No, you don't have to come.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.620
We can settle dinner by ourselves.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.379
Okay, goodbye.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.819
Great, see you soon.

You're here, Zhixia.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.499
I'm here to pick up Jiao.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.340
- Jiao.
- Mom!

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.779
Have you completed your homework?

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.699
You're early today, Miss Xu.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.819
As a managing director,

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.460
not to mention a pregnant one,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.659
it's normal for me
to come in late and leave early.

What's for dinner?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.099
Seafood feast.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.219
Hurry up and clean up.

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:49.300
Seafood feast.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.580
Really?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.460
Of course not. What are you thinking?

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.650
Well, did you hit the jackpot?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.900
Can't we eat something fancy
even if I didn't hit the jackpot?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.620
I must treat myself better.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.219
Let's go to the restaurant
that Mingzhu posted on her Moment.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.850
I'll go with Jiao. You don't have to go.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:05.539
If that's so,

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:06.819
I think I must

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.580
accompany my miladies.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.259
I hereby declare that I'm off work.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.640
- Come on. Let's go get dinner.
- No.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.180
We can wait. No hurry.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.740
It's all right.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.060
I can submit this
tomorrow, it's not urgent.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.110
Your mom always says we mustn't put off
until tomorrow what you can do today.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:21.860
Luo Yin also mentioned

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.740
that we must live in the moment.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.100
Should I listen to my mom

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.339
or Luo Yin?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.060
Your mom, of course.

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:29.780
Did Luo Yin give birth to you?

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:31.259
Well.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.300
Your mom is the worst.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.579
Come on.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:36.660
I saw the job offer

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.660
on the bulletin board.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.780
Have you submitted your application?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.459
Why do you keep checking the board?

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.780
Don't take too much seafood,
or you'll get an allergy.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.670
Talk about it at home.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.180
I'm not allergic to seafood though.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.459
Come on, we'll talk about this at home.

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:48.019
Let's go.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.060
Okay, we're leaving.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.920
See you soon.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.100
Well, the food is quite decent.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.660
It has no flaws
aside from being too pricey.

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:04.259
How pricey can it be?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.899
It is pricey.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:11.540
That's why we need to make more money.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.339
Have you applied for the position?

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:17.540
You made that face
when I asked you about it.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.459
I didn't.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.139
I heard a decision
has already been made.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.259
It's Wu from our department.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.740
Who said that?

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.130
I heard Wu talking about it.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:30.819
Everyone said so.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:32.540
There's no smoke without fire.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.300
Why should I
waste my effort applying then?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.019
Am I right?

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:37.540
You don't even know where the smoke is.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.890
Yet you say that you see the fire.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.820
If that's the case,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.100
Jiao won't make it to Tsinghua
or Peking University then.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.420
She might as well not study.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.420
You're shifting the concept.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.459
It's a different matter.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.240
But it's the same logic.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.320
Life is like sailing
against the current.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.950
If we don't move forward,
we fall behind.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.819
But sometimes taking a step back
opens up a world of possibilities.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.899
Is it good, Jiao?

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.100
Scrumptious.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.060
Delicious.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.899
If you find it tasty,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.300
do study hard.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.899
Study well to earn more money.

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:04.939
Then, you can eat here everyday.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.400
I just need to find a rich husband.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.740
That's easier than studying.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.339
Jiao.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.740
Do you think it's okay

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.899
to take money from someone?

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:17.980
It's not just someone, it's my husband.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.459
Your husband is not family.

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.220
Why would he treat you to a good meal?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.379
Calm down.

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.740
Be careful with the baby.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.459
Even though your husband
is not related to you by blood,

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.139
once you have a baby, that changes.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.259
You'll be a family.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:33.939
Family shares everything.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:34.860
That's right.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.540
Jiao.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.019
How can you be sure

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:40.699
that you'll find a rich husband?

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.939
Nowadays, a lot
of husbands lack ambition.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.100
You might get one who wants you
to treat him to meals instead.

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:49.819
I don't want that kind of husband then.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:50.540
Well.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.139
I'm full, mom.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.180
I'll get some ice cream.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.620
Jiao.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:57.259
Is she mocking me?

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.060
Zhang Hao.

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:01.699
Raising children is a lifelong lesson.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.819
We can't even solve the first problem.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.819
Are you ready for the second one?

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.550
Didn't your teacher teach you

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.950
to skip the problem first
if you don't know how to solve it?

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:18.860
Let's settle the bill first.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.259
Ice cream's on me.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.970
Ice cream counter is over there.
The strawberry flavor is nice.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.980
Ice cream is good.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:25.259
Jiao.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.220
Where's the ice cream?

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.339
Aunt.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.420
When you were pregnant with Xiaoni,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.150
did you have
an interstitial pregnancy too?

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:38.699
That's right.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.570
I don't know the answer
to this problem, Mom.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.220
Leave it blank first.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.860
Okay.

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:45.259
Listen.

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.139
I was really anxious then.

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:49.540
I couldn't sleep nor eat well.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.220
I was afraid that I might lose the baby.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.019
What happened then?

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:56.300
Then, Debao comforted me.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.540
He said

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.939
if the baby is meant to stay,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.660
she'll survive
even if I ran a marathon.

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:02.139
If she's not meant to stay,

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:03.980
I'd lose her
even if I just lifted my arm.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.950
He told me
to let nature take its course.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.579
I thought it through as well.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.259
I ate and slept like usual,

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:11.259
and I went to work too.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.300
I was still working
in the insurance company then.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:16.379
Look at Xiaoni now.

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.060
She's perfectly healthy.

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:20.860
Though she struggles with math.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.379
But she can do pulse diagnosis.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.139
What's wrong?

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:28.860
What's going on?

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.579
(Ni's Clinic)

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:33.939
What's wrong, Xiaoni?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.780
Get up, Xiaoni.

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:35.619
Stand up.

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.170
You didn't sit properly again, did you?

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:39.060
You're bleeding.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.060
Blood? I'm going to die.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.099
No, you're fine.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.180
Okay, it's all right now.

00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:49.339
Eat it.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.219
Mom.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.420
Just eat something.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.250
It won't do you
any good if you refuse to eat.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.540
I've been thinking about this.

00:09:00.099 --> 00:09:02.060
The more I think about it,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.339
the more I realise it's
all Shen Mingzhu's fault.

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:08.380
If Jianqi hadn't married Mingzhu,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.300
he wouldn't have
moved to that old house.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.360
Then, he wouldn't
have gone to that riverbank.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.099
And he wouldn't have
saved that drowning kid

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.579
and gotten himself killed.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.699
It's all Shen Mingzhu's fault.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.459
She's a cancer.

00:09:27.579 --> 00:09:30.140
No wonder
her biological parents abandoned her.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.619
Enough.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.540
What's the point of saying these now?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.300
I only have one son.

00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:44.819
Can't I rant about it?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.420
You seem to be doing well
even though your son has passed away.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.140
You're so cold-blooded.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.660
How can you eat?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.619
Do you have another son?

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.380
Nonsense.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.560
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.540
Your nonsense

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.140
cannot bring your son back to life.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.060
If you didn't drive his car,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.260
he wouldn't be dead.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.180
Stop it, Dad.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.500
It's Shen Minghui.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.099
He drove Jianqi's car.

00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:17.300
That's why I drove Jianqi's car back.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.420
It's all Shen Mingzhu's fault.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.099
The Shen family is to blame.

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:22.099
They're all monsters.

00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:24.420
Mingzhu is having Jianqi's baby.

00:10:24.699 --> 00:10:26.180
Is her baby at fault too?

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.730
Is her baby a monster too?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.060
You keep talking nonsense.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.219
I've had enough of you.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.979
Jianqi.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.300
Jianqi.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.420
Are you seeing this?

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:57.739
You've left.

00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:00.579
Well, I

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.939
don't want to live anymore.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.140
I'm unable to go on.

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:10.819
Jianqi.

00:11:11.819 --> 00:11:13.540
Open your eyes and see.

00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:15.780
Take a look.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.339
I...

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:24.979
I'm your mother.

00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:35.780
Be careful.

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:37.500
Are you okay, Xiaoni?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.099
It's no longer painful.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.660
Xiaoni.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.979
What's wrong with you?

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:44.180
She's naughty and fell down on her own.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.099
No, Mingzhu visited us.

00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:49.939
My mom just left me there
and they both chatted outside.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.219
You little naughty girl.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.939
You should have sat properly.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.540
You asked for this.

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:57.459
Can I play a little longer, Mom?

00:11:57.459 --> 00:11:58.380
No, let's go home.

00:11:58.699 --> 00:11:59.459
We'll get going.

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:00.260
Be careful.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.339
Dad!

00:12:01.339 --> 00:12:04.060
Look at your second wife.

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.380
What nonsense are you saying?

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.420
Hurry up and go home.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.859
I...

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.699
No...

00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:09.939
Go home.

00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:10.420
No.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.099
I still want to play.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.900
My diamond.

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:15.180
It's okay.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.219
I'll help you pick it up.

00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:18.080
My diamonds!

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.099
You dropped it yourself.

00:12:19.099 --> 00:12:20.260
No, we don't want it anymore.

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:22.619
Where are you going, Mom?

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.950
Xiaoni is crying. I'm going
to see what's happening.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.339
Xiaoni is my half sister.

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:29.459
She's not related to you by blood.

00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:30.300
Listen.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.750
The neighbours just had dinner
and have nothing to do now.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.060
Feel free to cry or laugh outside,

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.540
or it's okay
if you don't want to do both,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.750
they're eager to watch your drama.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.660
I'm not scared.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.060
I'm not the one who's cheating.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.859
The downside of
living in an old building.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.219
Everyone knows
every household's business.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.870
I told you to move,
you're the one who said no.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.910
Where should we move then?

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.699
No matter where we move,

00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:02.300
Ni Debao should face the music.

00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:04.939
Scum.

00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:07.939
You don't deserve the incense.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.500
What are you doing?

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.650
The diamonds are scattered everywhere.

00:13:23.859 --> 00:13:24.660
Stop it.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.979
It's not that valuable anyway.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.260
You don't understand.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.939
To Xiaoni, it's valuable.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.699
Fine.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.260
Hey, you're pregnant.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.260
Stand up.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.900
I'll pick it up.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.819
Xiaoni is such a billionaire.

00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:39.060
I didn't even have

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:41.060
such fancy toys when I was little.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.219
My mom never bought them for me.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.140
I'll buy them for you.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.579
You better. I want real ones.

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:47.859
I'll buy you real ones too.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.020
This much?

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:32.780
Jianqi.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.180
Jianqi!

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.780
Mingzhu.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:46.939
What's wrong?

00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:48.579
Ni's house is on fire.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.060
Ni's house is on fire!

00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:55.219
It's okay now.

00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:56.739
Don't barge in.

00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:00.780
There aren't any valuable items inside.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.619
An old house is still worth some money.

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:05.080
Money or getting your skin burned,
which one is more important?

00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:07.380
Stop it.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.699
I...

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.099
I bought insurance for the house.

00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:11.219
Insurance!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.459
Insurance.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.540
Is the fire covered by the insurance?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.619
Yes, it's covered.

00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:17.300
I think so.

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.420
It's okay, she bought insurance.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.260
Have you paid?

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:25.900
Good.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.819
The price has gone up.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.140
Small cost, small profit.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.780
Xiaoni.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.739
Go home soon.

00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:33.619
We're over there.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.939
You're cleaning up your house?

00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:35.780
That's right.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.099
It's all done now.

00:15:37.099 --> 00:15:37.780
Ni.

00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:39.459
- Where's my diamond?
- Xiaoni.

00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:41.619
Diamonds?

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.380
They're gone now.

00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:46.339
My house was burnt to ashes.

00:15:46.339 --> 00:15:47.380
There are no diamonds left.

00:15:48.099 --> 00:15:48.939
I'll leave then.

00:15:49.819 --> 00:15:51.339
Be careful when you play by the river.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.380
Let's get to work today.

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:55.219
It's going to take a while.

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:56.780
I heard that Jianqi's death benefit

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.060
is quite a large sum of money.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.480
No amount of money compares
to having your loved one alive.

00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:03.020
Listen.

00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:05.020
I have an aunt

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.900
who's living in the same neighbourhood
as Mingzhu's mother-in-law.

00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:09.540
Her mother-in-law keeps telling everyone

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.939
that Mingzhu is bad luck

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.780
and caused the death of Jianqi.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.619
Is that so?

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.780
Well.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.500
I think so.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.339
You saw Mingzhu go

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:18.300
to Ni's house, right?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.699
Yes, why?

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:22.739
It only took a few minutes
and Ni's house was on fire.

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:23.540
Exactly.

00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:25.339
That girl is bad luck.

00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:25.900
Right?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.310
Well, now that you mention it.

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:29.339
Better to believe it than ignore it.

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:30.939
Yes, she's bad luck.

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:31.900
It makes sense.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.619
What are you talking about?

00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:39.579
We're going to square dancing.

00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:40.739
Yes, square dancing.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.900
I'm still cooking porridge.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.060
Hurry up.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.099
The bean sprouts are fresh today.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.140
They're fresh.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.500
Yes.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.219
Here, thank you.

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:03.260
Have some water.

00:17:03.619 --> 00:17:04.500
Here, pass it over.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.659
Thank you.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.859
Come over, Xiaoni.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.099
Come to me.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.419
I have a question for you.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.579
Do you know what they were

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:16.419
talking about?

00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:18.339
They were talking about Mingzhu.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.780
What about Mingzhu?

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.460
They said Mingzhu is bad luck.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.419
She's just married,
yet her husband died.

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:32.260
Nonsense!

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.560
Say that again and I'll skin you!

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.740
I didn't say it, Mingzhu.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.659
They said it.

00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:39.339
Tell the other kids

00:17:39.379 --> 00:17:41.419
that if they dare to say it again,
I'll skin them!

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:42.020
Do you hear me?

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.659
Okay.

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:49.139
The kids don't know
what they're saying, just ignore them.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.780
I bought you a box of meat jerky.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.339
Thanks!

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.659
I'll go home first.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.619
What?

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.460
They said your sister is bad luck?

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.419
What is bad luck?

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.419
Their words are so mean.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.419
Who said it?

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.419
The neighbours.

00:18:12.419 --> 00:18:13.379
She's back.

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:14.980
You're back.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.300
Well.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.819
What would you like for lunch?

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:19.859
Your dad will cook.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.260
I'll cook anything you want.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.740
I'm not hungry, Mom.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.659
I'll go to my room upstairs.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.139
You're not eating?

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:27.780
How can you skip a meal?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.540
Your sister must have

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.220
heard all the rumors going around.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.619
Their mouths are so filthy.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.099
Mom.

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:42.940
No, Mom! Why are you holding a knife?

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.579
Don't stop me.

00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:44.860
Calm down, Mom!

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.099
Be careful, what are you doing?

00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:47.300
Put down the knife.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.659
What's going on?

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:50.020
Why are you so worked up?

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.179
I'm going to scare them.

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.020
What are you thinking?
Can you really do that?

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.859
Have a seat, Mom.

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:54.419
No... But...

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:55.780
I...

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.940
Well, you really need
to stop doing this.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.780
You're so annoying.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.899
I just want to scare them away.

00:19:00.899 --> 00:19:01.700
Scare who?

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:03.940
They can say what they want.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.700
Let them be.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.179
Let them say what they want.

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.619
What should we do then?

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:09.140
How can we let them spread such rumors?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.859
It's okay, Mom.

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:10.899
We'll think of something.

00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:24.700
Jianqi.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.899
If you didn't marry me,

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:31.220
you wouldn't have died, would you?

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.260
I think so too.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.980
But if you didn't marry me,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.579
you'd still be chasing after us,
and that's worse than dying.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.020
If only we could start over again.

00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:56.980
I won't date you.

00:19:58.379 --> 00:19:59.980
I'll keep my distance from you.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.950
You've been up
all night again, haven't you?

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.339
Do you want to nap for a bit?

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.940
It's windy today,
be careful not to catch a cold.

00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:37.780
Open the window.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.300
It's too stuffy here.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.339
You should go out
and take a stroll then.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.139
Ask Meiqi to go shopping with you

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.020
and have some facial spa.

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:01.540
My son is dead.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.460
I don't feel like getting a facial.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.060
If this gets out,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.940
people will think I'm a joke.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.740
We've provided enough jokes for them.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.379
Ever since Jianqi
fell in love with that girl,

00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:18.619
we've been like clowns.

00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:31.460
Mr. Shen.

00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:33.659
How's my girl doing?

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.220
Your girl?

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.379
She's my girl.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.339
Fine, your girl. How is she now?

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:40.659
She's down and keeping it to herself.

00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:43.579
Who spread the rumors?

00:21:43.579 --> 00:21:45.110
I'll find them and teach them a lesson.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.500
Dacheng.

00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:47.740
Hold on.

00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:49.379
We're living in a modern society.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.540
We need to handle this
with intelligence, not violence.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.500
Fine.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.540
I'll listen to you.
What should we do then?

00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:55.659
Which one?

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.220
I'll take you on my motorbike

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.460
and find them.

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:02.020
Don't drag me along.

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:04.740
By the way,

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:06.540
well.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.460
Can you lend me your sidecar?

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.419
I'll take our daughter...

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.300
I'll take my daughter.

00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:16.220
Whoever gossips about her

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.740
we'll go straight to their doorstep.

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:19.179
Let's see if they dare then.

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:21.060
Good idea.

00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:22.700
Get on the sidecar.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.819
Hold on.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.150
Do you have a driving license?

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:28.339
Yes, I know how to drive.

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:30.179
Hop on the sidecar.

00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:33.339
Wear your helmet.

00:22:33.339 --> 00:22:34.500
Well, look.

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.659
The procedure is correct.

00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:37.659
Good one.

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:52.659
Are you sure about this, Mr. Shen?

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.339
I know how to drive.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.179
It's just

00:22:55.339 --> 00:22:57.859
that it took me
three tries to pass the exam.

00:22:57.859 --> 00:22:59.579
I even became friends
with the examiners.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.940
Okay, go ahead.

00:23:03.379 --> 00:23:05.540
Okay, let's go.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:09.780
Good.

00:23:10.379 --> 00:23:11.260
Don't you worry.

00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:12.099
Good.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.260
Just ride it.
I'll bear the consequences.

00:23:17.859 --> 00:23:18.700
Steady.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.419
Go straight.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.859
Who knows?

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.859
Look, that's right.

00:23:25.859 --> 00:23:26.619
I know right.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.700
She fell down and then there was a fire.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.020
Yes, exactly.

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:35.179
What's wrong with you, Shen?

00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:36.139
You gave me a shock.

00:23:36.139 --> 00:23:37.139
That's right. It's scary.

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:38.700
I'm so sorry.

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:40.940
Are you chatting?

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.339
Yes, it's nothing.

00:23:43.139 --> 00:23:44.179
Nothing?

00:23:44.179 --> 00:23:44.980
What was it about?

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.220
You mean you're talking nonsense, right?

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.619
What do you mean?

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:49.859
How can you say that?

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.540
You can talk whatever you want,

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:55.500
but I can't drive however I want.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.899
It's dangerous.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.619
Shen.

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:00.300
It's not funny.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.700
That's right.

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:03.619
I'm not joking.

00:24:04.419 --> 00:24:05.579
What is he doing?

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.980
Gosh.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.139
Unbelievable.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.470
Shen Shengli isn't usually like this.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.060
But we're gossiping about his daughter.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.340
We should stop gossiping about her.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.060
- That's right.
- Let's go back to cook.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.099
Come on, let's go.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.020
Are you okay?

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.980
Be careful.

00:24:22.339 --> 00:24:23.139
Xiang.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.500
You're back, Dacheng.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.980
What's the good news, Dacheng?

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.060
Why are you so happy?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.300
Yes, it is a good one!

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:29.540
Dacheng.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.379
What happened?

00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:32.619
Come on.

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:33.819
Why are you riding a bicycle?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.379
Come on.

00:24:35.379 --> 00:24:37.540
Where's your sidecar?
Why should I get on your bicycle?

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.099
Where's your sidecar?

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.339
Listen.

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:42.500
Where did it go?

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.139
Listen.

00:24:44.419 --> 00:24:46.339
I lent it to Mr. Shen.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.740
Do you mean

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.819
that we're one step closer

00:24:51.819 --> 00:24:53.099
to Zhilu?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.419
Well done, Dacheng!

00:24:56.419 --> 00:24:57.379
Dacheng.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.940
Dacheng.

00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:03.619
Your sidecar is cool.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.339
Cool?

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:05.700
It's cool, Shen.

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:07.300
Did you just buy it?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.619
I've had it for a while.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.899
In fact, it belongs to a friend.

00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:12.619
Okay then.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.560
The usual combination.

00:25:14.819 --> 00:25:16.220
The usual combination. Have a seat.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.700
Okay, want a cigarette?

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.260
No, there are ladies around.

00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:20.540
Hurry up.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.619
Are you in your right mind?

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.460
Why are you on a motorbike?

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.819
This is so dangerous!

00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:26.980
I didn't ride it.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.139
Why are you wearing a helmet then?

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.419
I'm not blind, you know.

00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:31.500
I'm wearing the helmet...

00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:33.980
Are you in your right mind?

00:25:34.139 --> 00:25:35.700
What did I tell you?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.060
What did I say?

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.220
You said if I want to die early,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.379
I can ride the motorbike.

00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:42.220
If you dare
touch this again, I'll divorce you.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.540
Do you want a divorce?

00:25:43.579 --> 00:25:45.139
It's not my motorbike.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.020
This belongs to Xu Dacheng.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.780
- Who?
- Xu Dacheng.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.500
Mingzhu's father.

00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:53.940
You went to them?

00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:56.899
I didn't go to them.

00:25:56.899 --> 00:25:58.500
They came to me.

00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:00.619
They came to you again?

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:01.780
No.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.460
They knew that Mingzhu is being bullied.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.179
Xu Dacheng wanted to stand up for her.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.740
He wanted
to run people over with the motorbike.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.300
Well, I saw what he was about to do.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.139
How could I let him hit people with it?

00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:14.060
So, I stopped him.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.339
Then, he...

00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:18.099
Well, he left the motorbike here.

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:19.179
So, I pushed it back home.

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:20.780
Well, he's really reckless.

00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:21.659
I know right.

00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:23.619
What if someone got hurt
when he hits them?

00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:24.659
He'd go to jail.

00:26:24.659 --> 00:26:25.700
He's so reckless.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.740
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.179
You're too polite.

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:30.540
I've transferred the wages to you.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:30.980
Okay.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.740
Please check.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.540
Okay.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.260
Remember to send us the invoice.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.400
We'll claim the compensation
from the insurance company.

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:37.899
Okay.

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:39.379
We'll leave then, Miss Ni.

00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:39.780
All right.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.379
Come on.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.419
Thanks.

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:45.700
Mom.

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:48.099
Can't you leave Dad alone for a while?

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:48.940
No.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.260
People like him

00:26:51.899 --> 00:26:54.819
need to be nailed
to the pillar of shame.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.659
You climbed onto the wall again, Dad?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.619
That's your Dad's skill, Xiaoni.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.659
Where do you work now?

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:19.260
Hello!

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:21.819
- Meiqi.
- Meiqi.

00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:23.300
- Meiqi.
- Bichen.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.899
Have a seat.

00:27:24.899 --> 00:27:26.540
It's been a while.

00:27:26.659 --> 00:27:27.460
Come here.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.099
Hello, hello!

00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:29.819
Hi!

00:27:30.179 --> 00:27:31.060
We won't start eating

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.819
until our goddess arrives.

00:27:33.899 --> 00:27:35.020
Hey!

00:27:35.139 --> 00:27:36.139
Come here, have a seat.

00:27:36.139 --> 00:27:36.940
Have a seat.

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:38.980
Pour the drinks.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.819
Come on.

00:27:39.859 --> 00:27:40.780
Fill it up.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:41.659
Cheers!

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:42.940
Meiqi.

00:27:43.619 --> 00:27:45.579
It has been years,
but you still look the same.

00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:47.440
You're forever
the Goddess of Class 2 Senior 3.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.659
Yes, she's forever our Goddess.

00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:50.700
To our Goddess!

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.099
Cheers! Come on!

00:27:52.659 --> 00:27:53.980
Sorry, I have to take this call.

00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:58.659
Let's continue!

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.579
Hello, Mom.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.940
I'm here.

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:05.780
Okay, I'll come home
as soon as I'm done.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.780
I'm sorry.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.379
Another round!

00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:11.179
Come on.

00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:12.500
Welcome home, Meiqi.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.460
Thank you, everyone.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.379
Welcome.

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:15.179
Come on.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.619
- Bottoms up!
- Good one!

00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:21.740
This looks great, Meiqi.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.819
Thanks.

00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:24.379
You look even prettier now.

00:28:24.379 --> 00:28:25.179
Really?

00:28:25.619 --> 00:28:26.339
I bought this

00:28:26.339 --> 00:28:27.859
when I was at a concert in Paris.

00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:29.859
The brand is niche.

00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:31.819
If you like it,
I'll ask my friend to get one for you.

00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:32.640
Don't worry about it.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.700
It only looks good on you
because you're already gorgeous.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.179
Hey.

00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:37.339
I spend most of my time
in the cultural center.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.070
I'm very close with my colleagues.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.780
I have had a boyfriend
for a few years now too.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.940
It doesn't matter what I wear.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.060
As long as it's comfortable.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.980
That's not it.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.099
You have to step out
of your comfort zone.

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:47.619
Your clothes reflect your personality.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.379
I don't mind.

00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:50.859
My boyfriend

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.740
likes me as I am.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.850
He says I look good
no matter what I'm wearing.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.780
That's great.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.139
- Count me in too.
- Hey.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.740
Cheers!

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.179
Hello, Mom.

00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:09.460
Hey.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.700
I'm still eating.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.700
Stop calling me, okay?

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.099
I'll go back when I'm done.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.020
I know.

00:29:19.379 --> 00:29:21.819
One more round!

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.899
You've picked a nice hangout spot.

00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:26.419
- The food is delectable.
- Yummy!

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.099
You're truly the class monitor.

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.210
Cheers to our class monitor!

00:29:29.379 --> 00:29:29.859
Come on.

00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:33.700
What's this?

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.619
Seven-Star Formation.

00:29:36.139 --> 00:29:37.419
Don't touch it.

00:29:37.419 --> 00:29:38.540
It's to attract love.

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:39.980
Attract love?

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.659
It seems like it's not working.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.460
You can't touch it.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.850
If you touch it, I'd need
to degauss it. It's made of crystal.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.640
Don't blame me
if you can't find a husband.

00:29:56.139 --> 00:29:56.980
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:58.300
Well.

00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:01.020
Meiqi went out for a class reunion.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.859
She picked up my call ten minutes ago.

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:03.980
She said she's still eating.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.980
Then, she stopped picking up her phone.

00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:08.460
I can't reach her.

00:30:08.899 --> 00:30:10.780
Mingzhu. Did you know, Jianqi...

00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:11.899
Jianqi was like this too.

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:13.260
He didn't pick up his phone.

00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:14.980
Then, I lost him.

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:17.220
Don't worry, Mrs. Feng.

00:30:17.379 --> 00:30:18.770
Perhaps the restaurant is too noisy,

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.400
so Meiqi couldn't
hear her phone ringing.

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:22.619
She'll be fine with her classmates.

00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:23.740
Rest assured.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.020
Jianqi's mom is getting too obsessed.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.500
It has only been ten minutes.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.850
And she's calling Meiqi nonstop
and even called me for it.

00:30:37.339 --> 00:30:38.379
Okay, that's enough.

00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:39.419
Thank you.

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:41.179
The soup is quite refreshing.
Be careful, it's hot.

00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:41.940
Thanks.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.099
Here's a tissue.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.460
You haven't changed a bit.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.780
You're still so thoughtful.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.099
Might be due to
my profession as a teacher.

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:50.379
I have to be attentive,

00:30:50.379 --> 00:30:51.700
like a concerned old father.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:54.819
Meiqi.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.460
How long do you plan to stay this time?

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.010
Are you still returning
to the United Kingdom?

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.819
No.

00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:04.020
I plan to get a job here.

00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:06.740
I want to go to Shanghai.

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:08.139
Shanghai is a nice city.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.579
It's very modern, it suits you.

00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:12.819
Actually,

00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:14.899
I think Nanzhou is all right too.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.540
It's near to Shanghai.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.300
The property price

00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:19.659
is half of Shanghai's.

00:31:19.659 --> 00:31:22.060
Are you talking
about the property price, Hu Gang?

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.220
Meiqi is from a wealthy family.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.579
She wouldn't even bother.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.460
That's right.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.740
Hu Gang.

00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:30.300
Stop asking so many questions.

00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:31.899
Come clean.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.540
Were you one of her admirers back then?

00:31:36.619 --> 00:31:39.020
No, I wasn't.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:39.819
No.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.980
Cheers.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.940
Do you have a boyfriend now, Meiqi?

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:47.740
I'm single and ready to mingle.

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:50.339
There's a chance!

00:31:50.339 --> 00:31:50.980
Come on.

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:22.740
I'm back, Mom.

00:32:23.899 --> 00:32:25.179
You kept calling me.

00:32:25.179 --> 00:32:27.379
My phone almost
ran out of battery from your calls.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.099
Mom.

00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:49.260
Mom?

00:32:56.179 --> 00:32:56.980
Aunt.

00:32:58.179 --> 00:32:58.980
Aunt.

00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:00.980
Aunt.

00:33:02.579 --> 00:33:03.419
Where's my mom?

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.859
Isn't Mrs. Feng at home?

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:08.379
I don't know.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.899
Hey, Meiqi.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.260
Mrs. Feng has gone missing?

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:33.139
Has she reached out to you?

00:33:33.139 --> 00:33:34.220
Stay alert.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.060
Okay.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.139
If she calls you, let me know.

00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:38.099
Noted.

00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:39.819
Well, is my sister-in-law at your place?

00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:40.540
It's urgent.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.460
No.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.700
All right, okay.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.220
My mom called me
20 times in the afternoon.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.700
I got annoyed and turned off my phone.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.859
When I came back,

00:33:49.859 --> 00:33:50.859
she was gone.

00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:53.099
She didn't bring
her phone with her either.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.659
Where would she go?

00:33:54.659 --> 00:33:55.500
She'll be okay.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.260
Calm down, Meiqi.

00:33:57.859 --> 00:34:00.379
She's been saying
that she doesn't want to live on.

00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:02.179
Negative things like that.

00:34:02.179 --> 00:34:03.659
She will be okay, won't she?

00:34:03.819 --> 00:34:04.619
Meiqi.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.780
Mingzhu.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.460
How is it?

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.650
- Nothing.
- Mingzhu.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.699
Your mom called me

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:10.980
around 1:00 PM today.

00:34:11.099 --> 00:34:12.139
What did she say?

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.550
She said she's worried
as you were not picking up your phone.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.020
- What should I do?
- Don't panic.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.540
Have you checked the
neighborhood's surveillance footage?

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.820
We're checking.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.259
Okay, please look into it.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.060
Dad.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.779
Feng.

00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:26.619
I went around the neighbourhood
and checked the surveillance footage.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.420
She

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.380
left around 4:00 PM

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:31.820
and she didn't look well.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:33.500
I'll make a few calls to check.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.420
Feng.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.779
- I'll check with Uncle.
- Go ahead, we haven't checked yet.

00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:38.900
- Hurry up.
- I'll go along too.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.619
Go now, hurry up!

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:40.699
Okay, come on.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.099
Where could she go?

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:44.219
It's all my fault.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:45.820
We will find her.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.699
It's my fault.

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.699
I didn't pick up her calls.

00:34:49.259 --> 00:34:50.060
Have you found her?

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:50.940
You're here.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.500
What's the matter?

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.579
Uncle.

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:55.930
- Shall we file a police report?
- I've reported to the police.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.980
Jianqi's uncle is at the police station.

00:34:58.099 --> 00:34:58.860
There's no news yet.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.139
- How is it?
- What's the status, Uncle?

00:35:04.139 --> 00:35:05.779
I even went to Jianqi's cemetery.

00:35:05.779 --> 00:35:06.460
She's not there.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.900
Have you tried 3rd Aunt's place?

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.259
No.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.860
Hurry up then, we'll go.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.420
Come on.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.140
- Chop-chop!
- We'll try looking for her.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.500
Why am I such a scum?

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.779
Why did I turn off my phone?

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:20.099
What if something happens to her?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.500
It won't, Meiqi.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.219
Mother...

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.299
She promised to help me
take care of the baby.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.779
Have you searched the riverbank?

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:28.980
Riverbank?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.179
The river where Jianqi saved that child.

00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:31.940
That's right.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.980
She might have gone there.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.380
It's possible.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.460
Come on, let's go check it out.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.579
Let's go.

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:36.139
Come on.

00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:40.380
Come up, it's dangerous!

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.619
Come up!

00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:46.060
It's dangerous there, you'll drown!

00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:48.340
Listen, come up now.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.460
Come up! I'll go get your teachers.

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.540
I'll get your teachers to punish you.

00:35:57.659 --> 00:35:59.900
It's dangerous, you'll drown.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.259
My son drowned here.

00:36:02.259 --> 00:36:04.540
Come up!

00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:06.619
Hurry up and come up!

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:08.179
It's dangerous.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.179
Mrs. Feng!

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.460
Come up!

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.779
What are you doing, Mrs. Feng?

00:36:11.779 --> 00:36:12.699
Listen.

00:36:12.699 --> 00:36:14.560
- It's very dangerous down there!
- Mrs. Feng.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:15.980
Why are you here?

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.420
Don't go there, Mrs. Feng.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.380
They refuse to come up.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.179
- Mrs. Feng.
- Let's not bother about them, Mom.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.259
Let's go home.

00:36:22.259 --> 00:36:23.820
Let's go home, just let them be.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.020
No, it's dangerous.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.699
I'm not leaving.

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:26.980
Come up now, Wang Jiarui!

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.699
You rascal!

00:36:27.699 --> 00:36:29.219
Otherwise, I'd tell your Grandpa!

00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:31.060
I'll call him right now.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.219
Come up!

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:13.659
How is she now?

00:37:13.659 --> 00:37:14.980
Is she asleep?

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.259
She took a sleeping pill.

00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:19.420
Where did you get the sleeping pill?

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:20.579
It's mine.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.779
Sometimes I find it hard
to sleep as I'm too busy with work.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.820
I'll take one then.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.179
I have a classmate.

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:33.579
He's a neurologist.

00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:35.380
He told me

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.500
that her condition

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.500
might be

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.659
PT...

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.020
PTSD.

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.139
That's right.

00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:44.060
Yes, PTSD.

00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:45.980
Which is post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:37:48.139 --> 00:37:49.219
Is it serious?

00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:52.099
She can't be triggered.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.739
Some people are more sensitive.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.099
After World War II,

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.460
a lot of American soldiers
had the disorder.

00:38:22.659 --> 00:38:23.940
I'm done, Mom.

00:38:24.779 --> 00:38:25.739
Good job!

00:38:26.259 --> 00:38:27.299
You deserve a thumbs up.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.179
You're eager to practice piano now.

00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:31.579
Of course.

00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:33.579
I can't let my talents go to waste.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.540
I'll go to bed now.

00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:38.139
Okay, darling. Good night.

00:38:38.779 --> 00:38:39.579
Good night.

00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:48.860
I can't let my talents go to waste.

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:53.259
Mom.

00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:54.900
Mom.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.820
Come here, Mom.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.500
What's the matter?

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:04.900
Can you sleep with me?

00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:06.500
Sleep by yourself.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.699
I'm still working, Jiao.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.940
Are you not accompanying me?

00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:18.820
Fine.

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:22.619
I'll accompany you.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.699
Why are you staring at me?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.619
Jiao.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.619
You have so many requests tonight.

00:39:48.659 --> 00:39:50.420
Can I have a request too?

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:53.860
Can you manage to score

00:39:54.299 --> 00:39:56.460
95 and above for tomorrow's paper?

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.099
Answer me.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.099
I'm accompanying you now.

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:08.779
No, I'm a grown up now.

00:40:13.179 --> 00:40:14.940
Let's let each other go.

00:40:25.179 --> 00:40:26.460
Good night, darling.

00:40:26.779 --> 00:40:27.579
Good night.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.739
It's the donut that Jiao asked for.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.050
It's on sale after 8:00 PM.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.659
Sadly, there aren't
any chocolateflavor.

00:40:57.659 --> 00:40:59.020
So, I bought her strawberry flavor.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.810
Have you filled out
the job application form?

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.980
No hurry, there's still plenty of time.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:06.739
Zhang Hao.

00:41:09.659 --> 00:41:10.860
Are you going

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.940
to buy the bread on sale after 8:00 PM

00:41:13.299 --> 00:41:15.619
and always fail to buy
your daughter's favourite flavour?

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:17.380
You mean I should buy
not the one on sale,

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.739
but the one that is expensive?

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.150
You got a job promotion
but you forgot how to do math?

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.980
It's a different matter.

00:41:24.219 --> 00:41:25.540
I'm talking about you.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.779
If you can

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.739
grow in your career,

00:41:30.739 --> 00:41:32.860
you can feel free
to buy any donuts you want.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.860
Free?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.540
I'm free.

00:41:35.739 --> 00:41:36.820
Jiao wants a donut.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.020
I bought her a pack of donuts.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.950
Are you filling out the form or not?

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.530
If you don't fill,
I won't give birth to the baby.

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:48.779
You're being unreasonable.

00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:52.699
I'll do it now.

00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:57.099
I'll stick it with glue next time.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.139
Hurry up, you're going to be late, Jiao.

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:07.259
Okay!

00:42:10.259 --> 00:42:10.900
Jiao.

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:13.820
Remember to check your answers
during the examination later.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.579
Do you hear me?

00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:16.050
Don't forget what you said last night.

00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:16.860
What?

00:42:18.219 --> 00:42:19.659
Let each other go.

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:22.699
Come on, change your shoes.

00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:26.699
Quick.

00:42:28.259 --> 00:42:29.460
Check your answers!

00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:31.179
Let each other go.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.699
What is it? What did you forget?

00:42:37.699 --> 00:42:38.779
Umbrella. The weather forecast
says it's going to rain later.

00:42:38.779 --> 00:42:39.659
Hurry up.

00:42:39.739 --> 00:42:40.619
