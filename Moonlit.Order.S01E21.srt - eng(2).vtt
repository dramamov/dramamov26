=Episode 21=

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:43.459
So you've been involved all along,

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:45.898
hiding your true identity
from the start,

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.379
and using my gratitude
towards Young Master?

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:49.938
You're

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.659
a monster with hands
drenched in carnage.

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:55.979
And you fantasize about
others fighting for your affection?

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:05.298
Go be a couple with Xue Hexu

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:08.618
in the underworld!

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:16.419
You villain.

00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:17.178
You bullied

00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:18.618
Father, Hexu, and Stepmother.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:19.618
Get lost.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:20.538
Get lost.

00:02:21.098 --> 00:02:21.738
Go away.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:23.738
Dongyang.

00:02:23.818 --> 00:02:25.419
Let me say it one last time.

00:02:26.658 --> 00:02:28.419
Before I achieve my goal,

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:30.178
you'd better

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.979
stay put and behave.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.458
If anyone ruins my plans,

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.178
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.936
(Memorial)

00:02:58.818 --> 00:02:59.499
Guards.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:03.258
Guards!

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.299
Where is everyone?

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.419
Your Majesty's health declines,

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.219
yet your temper still blazes

00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:29.699
like midsummer sun.

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:35.178
Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:38.419
I didn't summon you.

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.458
How dare you barge in?

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.219
I wouldn't dare.

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.178
Your Majesty,

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:46.898
since you're unwell

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.939
and confused,

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.779
(Memorial)
let me handle

00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:53.098
the state affairs

00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:55.618
on your behalf.

00:03:57.898 --> 00:03:58.378
You...

00:04:28.938 --> 00:04:29.498
Mr. Gu.

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:31.538
Why did you climb the wall

00:04:32.058 --> 00:04:33.778
instead of taking the entrance?

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:35.699
Because I'm skilled.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:38.739
So skilled.

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:41.579
Minor mishap.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.658
I've been wondering

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:47.098
why I haven't seen Feng.

00:04:47.338 --> 00:04:48.098
Did something

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:49.378
happen at home?

00:04:49.778 --> 00:04:51.258
Could you check for me?

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:56.098
I already did.

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.619
They're gone.

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:01.538
What?

00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:04.658
His Majesty accused your family

00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:05.938
of usurpation

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:07.538
and put everyone in prison,

00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:08.776
including Feng Zuoren.

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:09.979
A bunch of seniors

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:11.098
and weaklings rebelled?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.859
Grand Tutor Zhou must be behind this.

00:05:15.378 --> 00:05:16.218
And Xue Youshou?

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.419
He wouldn't harm
his own family, would he?

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:23.139
Mr. Gu.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:24.699
Find Feng

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:25.579
in the prison

00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:27.378
and get the full story.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:29.299
I'm about to.

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:31.218
Then investigate Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:32.419
Absolutely.

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:34.658
We'll make plans after you return.

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:40.058
Are you giving me orders?

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:42.419
Would I dare?

00:05:42.498 --> 00:05:43.579
Don't make fun of me.

00:05:43.818 --> 00:05:45.818
I merely voiced

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:47.218
what you already planned.

00:05:47.778 --> 00:05:49.218
You're truly insightful.

00:05:49.258 --> 00:05:50.058
My respect.

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:52.739
You rascal.

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.979
Low on skills

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:55.619
but sharp-eyed.

00:05:56.538 --> 00:05:56.979
Fine.

00:05:58.098 --> 00:05:59.899
We'll follow my plan.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.459
Give me two liang.

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:19.778
I'll teach you a defense move.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:41.096
I won.

00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:43.739
- Again?
- Pay up.

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:45.019
So lucky.

00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:48.139
Have you heard?

00:06:48.778 --> 00:06:49.419
Something big

00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:50.979
will happen tomorrow.

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:51.579
Like what?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.139
Like what?

00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:53.338
Come on.

00:06:53.498 --> 00:06:54.538
Don't speak riddles.

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:56.498
Heaven will send omens tomorrow.

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:57.378
It could mean

00:06:57.538 --> 00:06:58.899
a change in rulership.

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:00.818
Don't say that.

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:02.218
That's a capital offense.

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:03.179
Seriously.

00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:04.619
Grand Tutor Zhou said so.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:05.058
He will

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.179
also sacrifice
Feng Zuoren to the heavens.

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.459
That unfilial wretch.

00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:33.019
All these years,
Hexu scraped together money

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.818
to provide for him.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:37.818
Hexu may seem to be

00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:40.459
living a peaceful life,

00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:41.459
but

00:07:41.818 --> 00:07:43.979
he's spared no effort
for the Xue family.

00:07:44.218 --> 00:07:45.378
Now my ungrateful son

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.658
has gone completely mad.

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:49.859
But the root cause of all this

00:07:50.338 --> 00:07:50.859
is you.

00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:52.419
To save others,

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:53.979
you abandoned your own child

00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:56.739
and even made him the scapegoat.

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:58.338
Anyone would

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.658
struggle with such betrayal by family.

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:03.058
His bitterness

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:04.299
and these actions

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:06.899
didn't come from nowhere.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.459
There's something you should know.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:18.378
Xue Hexu

00:08:19.258 --> 00:08:19.979
is still alive.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:24.818
I believe

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.658
he'll find a way

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:27.699
to save us all.

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:31.139
Apologies for

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:33.098
interrupting your family reunion.

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:35.898
I heard the jailers say

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:36.979
that Grand Tutor

00:08:37.218 --> 00:08:39.218
plans to fabricate
an auspicious sign tomorrow

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:40.419
to usurp Emperor Jia

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:42.739
and kill you as a sacrifice.

00:08:43.138 --> 00:08:43.898
Kill me?

00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:45.778
Few in this world

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:47.098
could end me.

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:51.018
I happen to be one of them.

00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:57.059
An auspicious sign...

00:08:59.658 --> 00:09:01.499
Find out where, when,

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:03.018
and how they will

00:09:03.098 --> 00:09:04.018
stage this.

00:09:05.138 --> 00:09:06.018
I'm about to.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:06.939
I'll stay here

00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:08.979
to protect the Xues from assassins.

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:10.338
We'll make plans

00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:11.578
once you're back.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:17.138
Wait a minute.

00:09:18.218 --> 00:09:19.898
Why are you telling me what to do

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:21.538
just like Xue Hexu?

00:09:22.338 --> 00:09:24.819
What imperial rank do you two even hold?

00:09:26.698 --> 00:09:28.578
We entrust this matter to you, Mr. Gu.

00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:33.578
You honor me, my lord.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:35.458
You're a respectable man.

00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:37.658
Unlike some

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:39.619
rude fellas.

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:52.138
At Yin hour tomorrow,

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.419
everything will be ready.

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:57.259
The Wu Hour is auspicious.

00:09:57.658 --> 00:09:58.538
We will announce

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.979
that you are the former Crown Prince.

00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:03.979
Rest assured.

00:10:04.218 --> 00:10:05.658
I've made thorough preparations.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.578
The sky will blaze crimson.

00:10:10.578 --> 00:10:11.859
No one will doubt

00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:14.379
your divine mandate.

00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:27.778
To our lame emperor.

00:10:35.394 --> 00:10:38.184
(Administrative Office)

00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:39.658
Here.

00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:40.218
Alright.

00:10:52.098 --> 00:10:53.499
(9527)
The rest go in the back.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:54.018
Alright.

00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:34.138
Fruits.

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:36.458
Lucky me.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:08.538
You cleaned up this place.

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:10.619
What a capable partner.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:13.338
Mr. Gu.

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:16.778
Mr. Gu.

00:12:17.698 --> 00:12:18.218
Have some tea.

00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:24.379
Whoever marries you

00:12:24.859 --> 00:12:25.778
will be blessed.

00:12:36.698 --> 00:12:37.898
Feng Zuoren is taking care

00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:38.939
of your family.

00:12:39.338 --> 00:12:39.979
Don't worry.

00:12:42.338 --> 00:12:43.979
Jing'an Bureau yielded no leads.

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.059
But I found clues
at the Grand Tutor's Mansion.

00:12:46.939 --> 00:12:48.098
Did you find out

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:50.419
how they'll create the auspicious sign?

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:55.018
They mentioned crimson skies,

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:57.179
but I didn't get

00:12:57.338 --> 00:12:58.098
the specifics.

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:00.658
Crimson skies...

00:13:01.098 --> 00:13:02.218
I still got something

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:03.698
from the Jing'an Bureau.

00:13:07.698 --> 00:13:08.138
Here.

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:20.859
Something is wrong with it.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.218
What's wrong?

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:30.979
The fruits carry

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:32.739
a faint gunpowder scent.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:33.939
They're stored

00:13:34.098 --> 00:13:35.218
with gunpowder.

00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:38.739
Is it possible

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:41.179
that they're moving gunpowder

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:43.179
under the disguise of fruit shipments?

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:46.619
Crimson skies.

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:50.179
Gunpowder.

00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:54.338
(Map)
There are two artillery depots.

00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:57.138
One near the Royal Altar,

00:13:57.458 --> 00:13:59.379
the other adjacent to Xue Mansion.

00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:02.578
Why fake auspicious signs
at artillery depots?

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:04.619
The depot near the Xue Mansion

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:06.698
solidifies Xue Youshou's identity.

00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:07.939
It confirms that

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:10.059
the Xue family was sheltering

00:14:10.138 --> 00:14:11.499
the former Crown Prince.

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:12.499
The Royal Altar

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:14.739
is where the imperial ancestors
are worshiped.

00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:16.578
Grand Tutor Zhou will use gunpowder

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:19.018
at both locations simultaneously

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:21.819
to fake auspicious signs.

00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:24.658
He will execute Feng,
His Majesty's confidant,

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:25.739
and present

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.299
Xue Youshou as the rightful successor

00:14:27.778 --> 00:14:28.859
to force the abdication.

00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:34.338
A flawless plan.

00:14:36.098 --> 00:14:36.778
However,

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:39.979
we'll create a flaw.

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:42.619
Let's split up.

00:14:43.619 --> 00:14:44.808
I'll go to the Royal Altar.

00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:46.299
You'll steal the gunpowder from

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:47.458
the depot near home.

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:47.939
No need.

00:14:48.898 --> 00:14:49.739
I have a better plan.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.259
I knew it.

00:16:53.059 --> 00:16:54.179
You can't poop here.

00:16:57.578 --> 00:16:58.499
Don't be ridiculous.

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:01.338
Constipated? Your nose is red.

00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:02.898
I was ambushed.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.578
Will it work?

00:17:07.938 --> 00:17:08.379
Yeah.

00:17:09.058 --> 00:17:09.779
You'll see.

00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:11.418
Let's go.

00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:18.010
(Pancake)

00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:23.779
Sir, two steamed buns.

00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:25.739
Please come in.

00:17:28.139 --> 00:17:28.818
Have you heard?

00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:29.979
Prince Jia Xun is back.

00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:30.938
Yeah, I heard.

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:32.619
Later at noon,

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:34.539
they'll recognize his status.

00:17:35.899 --> 00:17:36.619
I also heard

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.659
that His Majesty usurped the throne.

00:17:38.818 --> 00:17:40.058
Now the former Crown Prince.

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.058
There will be drama.

00:17:43.338 --> 00:17:44.218
No political talk.

00:17:44.418 --> 00:17:45.418
Are you crazy?

00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:46.218
Let's eat.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:53.899
Imperial Guards.

00:17:54.818 --> 00:17:55.899
Imperial Guards.

00:17:57.499 --> 00:17:58.938
Imperial Guards!

00:18:24.578 --> 00:18:25.139
Your Majesty.

00:18:26.818 --> 00:18:27.458
Your Majesty.

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:31.298
Your Majesty.

00:18:31.659 --> 00:18:32.338
Come with me.

00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:33.659
I'm here to save you.

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:35.539
How did you get in?

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:38.899
No time to explain.

00:18:39.298 --> 00:18:40.938
Let me get you out first.

00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:41.739
Let's go.

00:18:52.739 --> 00:18:53.338
Mr. Immortal.

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.499
Weren't we escaping?

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:55.619
Why are we here?

00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:04.019
Long live Your Majesty!

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:06.779
Rise...

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:07.938
Rise.

00:19:08.698 --> 00:19:10.019
We thank Your Majesty.

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:15.218
Your Majesty.

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:18.979
You are unwell.

00:19:19.218 --> 00:19:20.739
You shouldn't wander about.

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:22.139
What if

00:19:22.379 --> 00:19:23.818
you get hurt?

00:19:25.899 --> 00:19:26.739
What's happening?

00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:28.539
Don't worry.

00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:29.859
As long as I live,

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:31.458
I'll protect you.

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:36.539
Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:19:36.938 --> 00:19:37.979
You dare commit treason!

00:19:38.298 --> 00:19:40.178
Aren't you afraid of public scorn?

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:42.619
This isn't treason, Your Majesty.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:44.218
Your throne

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:46.338
should've been relinquished long ago.

00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:47.899
How dare you!

00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:49.539
Your Majesty,

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.338
the former Crown Prince
you've sought for years

00:19:52.499 --> 00:19:54.499
stands right beside you.

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:20.698
You?

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:24.298
It's you.

00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:27.739
I worked hard to obtain

00:20:27.938 --> 00:20:29.739
the former Crown Prince's portrait.

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:40.338
Jia Xun.

00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:42.539
You've deceived the throne.

00:20:43.698 --> 00:20:45.098
But you're not a true ruler.

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:46.499
Jia Ji.

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:48.779
The mandate of heaven

00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:50.739
has shifted into the hands

00:20:51.218 --> 00:20:52.539
of the one with true virtue.

00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:55.659
This is the way of nature.

00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:58.058
You killed your blood
and lack the virtue

00:20:58.058 --> 00:20:58.979
to claim the throne.

00:20:59.739 --> 00:21:00.499
You should have

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:02.899
stepped down a long time ago.

00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:17.379
Open up.

00:21:20.619 --> 00:21:22.298
Miss Feng, Grand Tutor Zhou

00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:23.539
wishes to discuss

00:21:24.098 --> 00:21:25.458
urgent matters with you.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:27.379
- My child.
- Stepmother.

00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:28.458
Don't go.

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:31.139
Don't worry, Grandmother.

00:21:31.578 --> 00:21:32.418
I'll be fine.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:34.698
Nuannuan,

00:21:35.218 --> 00:21:36.136
take care of everyone.

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:37.178
Stepmother.

00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:39.098
Miss Feng.

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:41.938
We'll be waiting for you.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.499
Why did you pose as a Daoist priest

00:21:56.698 --> 00:21:57.619
to deceive people?

00:21:58.019 --> 00:21:58.539
Exactly!

00:21:59.338 --> 00:22:00.659
You claim this random man

00:22:00.899 --> 00:22:02.379
is the former Crown Prince.

00:22:02.619 --> 00:22:03.698
What are you scheming?

00:22:04.818 --> 00:22:06.338
Your Majesty knows full well

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.298
whether he is an imposter.

00:22:13.418 --> 00:22:14.298
Mr. Immortal.

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:17.379
How could it be you?

00:22:18.698 --> 00:22:21.298
You were my most trusted confidant.

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:24.379
Jia Xun.

00:22:25.298 --> 00:22:27.259
You've been deceiving me all along.

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:30.779
You torched the royal retreat,

00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:33.098
trying to kill your own brother.

00:22:33.578 --> 00:22:35.178
Blinded by power,

00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:36.218
you seized the throne

00:22:36.739 --> 00:22:38.098
and deceived your people.

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:40.619
How is this not deception?

00:22:42.899 --> 00:22:44.938
The late Emperor
favored his youngest son,

00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:47.458
ignoring true merit.

00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:49.659
All of this

00:22:50.298 --> 00:22:52.418
was his mistake.

00:22:56.218 --> 00:22:57.418
Everyone knows that

00:22:58.338 --> 00:23:00.338
when the late Emperor ruled,

00:23:01.139 --> 00:23:03.418
Prince Jia Xun was the hope and made

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:06.698
the Crown Prince at the age of three.

00:23:07.458 --> 00:23:08.458
But Jia Ji

00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:11.659
with his wolfish ambition,

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:13.139
betrayed brotherly bonds.

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:15.259
He tried to murder Jia Xun

00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:17.458
and steal the throne.

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:23.779
Jia Ji.

00:23:24.739 --> 00:23:25.899
Your claim to the throne

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:28.539
was illegitimate.

00:23:28.938 --> 00:23:29.539
How dare you!

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:32.098
His Majesty has governed diligently,

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:33.818
while you two

00:23:34.218 --> 00:23:35.379
conjure cheap tricks here.

00:23:35.739 --> 00:23:38.218
You even staged this show
to force abdication!

00:23:38.259 --> 00:23:39.338
What you have done

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:40.938
can't convince the people.

00:23:41.418 --> 00:23:43.938
His Majesty has heaven's mandate.

00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:46.779
Jia Xun is the rightful heir.

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:55.899
Truth is, I'm not Jia Xun.

00:23:57.418 --> 00:23:59.178
I'm just an ordinary man.

00:24:00.899 --> 00:24:03.779
Both royals and Xues are ruthless.

00:24:04.298 --> 00:24:04.979
Why not

00:24:05.698 --> 00:24:07.139
let a commoner like me

00:24:07.818 --> 00:24:09.019
inherit the throne?

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:10.859
What's wrong with that?

00:24:12.058 --> 00:24:12.458
What...

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:13.659
What...

00:24:15.418 --> 00:24:16.098
Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:24:16.578 --> 00:24:18.098
He's not the former Crown Prince.

00:24:18.418 --> 00:24:19.218
How can you

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.938
betray Hua's ancestors
and put him on the throne?

00:24:23.178 --> 00:24:24.698
His Majesty has lost it.

00:24:29.298 --> 00:24:30.458
Who becomes the Emperor

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:32.578
and the royal blood

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:34.458
means nothing to me.

00:24:35.818 --> 00:24:36.698
I only care

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:39.938
about becoming the Regent.

00:24:40.818 --> 00:24:42.098
Heaven above.

00:24:44.418 --> 00:24:47.259
If you recognize Jia Xun
as the rightful ruler,

00:24:48.698 --> 00:24:51.218
send us an auspicious sign.
