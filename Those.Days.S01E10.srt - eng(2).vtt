=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.780
=Episode 10=

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:27.440
You look good.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.160
I've been sleeping well.

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:33.319
The results are good.
The gestational sac is now normal.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.570
The fetus is completely healthy.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720
I just heard the fetal heartbeat.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.119
Like a little horse trotting.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.039
It means he's very healthy.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.559
Let me see the blood work.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.559
The blood test is fine too.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.759
Progesterone is normal.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.720
The results are very good.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.679
You have nothing to worry about
at your age.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.759
I see you're wearing red socks.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.160
Is this your zodiac year?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.160
I wear these from my zodiac year

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.720
until I turn 30.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.040
But I still got cheated.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.279
They say your zodiac year is a hurdle.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.439
But I think we need to
look at it dialectically.

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.080
Sometimes setbacks
are like inflammation.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.879
It's a process of slow healing.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.760
It reminds us to increase our immunity

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.960
at life's key moments,
to be more positive.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.399
Just like your gestational sac,

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.679
it had to work hard
to get back into the uterus,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.599
right?

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.520
So, I can keep the baby?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.399
Of course you can.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040
Can I swim?

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.360
Swimming is fine, in moderation.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.879
Okay.

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.719
Bye.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.279
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.920
Is it raining?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.879
It's fine, even the biggest rain stops.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.040
I'll just wait a bit.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.200
(No rush,
I'll wait for the rain to stop.)

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.200
Didn't she forget something again?

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.999
What time is it now?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.839
The rain started so suddenly.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
I thought Jiao forgot something.

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.159
Raising a girl is such a hassle.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.320
What do you mean?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.360
Raising a boy is hard too.
They all need effort.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.960
It has nothing to do with gender, okay?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.200
Yes, yes, you're right.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:38.240
Right.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.839
Raising a boy,
they're tough when they're little.

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.119
But when they're older,

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.279
they need a girlfriend,

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.320
marriage, a house, a car...

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.200
It strips you of everything.

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:57.360
It's so difficult.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.719
Oh, right.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.240
Zhidong said

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.999
that Bichen's family wants to meet.

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.439
But...

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.040
I'm scared.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.200
I'm afraid they'll bring up
about buying a house.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.080
We...

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.520
We can't afford it.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.640
So I'm stalling.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.200
I don't dare meet them.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.719
I'll put it off as long as I can.

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.159
Can you put it off forever?

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.760
Think of something.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.680
What can I think of?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.000
There's no way.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.520
Let's focus on my daughter first.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.000
Then the daughter-in-law.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.080
Here, this is

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.799
for Mingzhu.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.520
And

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.919
this one is for you.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.479
When you have no appetite,

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.039
have it with your congee.

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.919
Since we found Mingzhu,
I'm just an afterthought, huh?

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.839
You're the second one.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:55.320
You know.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.320
Don't think I don't know.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.479
You're not just here
to drop off the pickles.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.200
You want to see Mingzhu's Moment, right?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.159
I'm here to drop off the pickles sand
to see her Moment.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.080
Here you go.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.399
Continue your work.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.540
(I know you're watching me.)

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.660
(No rush,
I'll wait for the rain to stop.)

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.039
Hey.

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.320
Zhixia, you're busy.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.159
I'm leaving now.

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.320
Leaving so soon?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.399
I'm fine. I'm going.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.520
I'm done.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.960

Where is the OBGYN Department?

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.399
Miss, where is the OBGYN Department?

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:56.200
On the third floor.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.960
Third floor.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.919
Thank you.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.080
Let's play.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.440
Raise your hand. One, two, three.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.719
One, two, three.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.279
One, two, three.

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.239
Auntie.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.399
Pretty auntie.

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:29.200
Dirty hands.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.000
Zhu.

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:32.239
Mom, why are you here?

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:33.440
It's raining so hard.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.799
Dad didn't bring you an umbrella.

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:36.039
Wait, you're all wet.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:36.760
I'm fine.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.080
I told you I'd come with you.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080
But you wouldn't let me.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.239
You're pregnant, you can't take medicine

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.680
or get caught in the rain. Let's go.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.479
It's fine, I'll go home
when the rain stops.

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:46.080
Why did you come to pick me up?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.760
Let's go.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.359
Stop talking.

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:48.200
My bag.

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:50.359
Always losing things.

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:52.239
How is it?

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.000
Mingzhu.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.799
Why are you two here?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.359
My mom saw your post

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.000
saying you were stuck at the hospital.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.760
She got so worried,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.220
insisted on bringing you an umbrella.

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.680
The rain was too heavy, I'm worried.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.159
You're not well yourself.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.000
I told you I'd treat you
like my daughter,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.839
and I keep my word.

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.000
Mom, Mom, let's go.

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:19.960
Let's go.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.359
What did you just call me?

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:27.640
Mom.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.120
Let's go.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.119
Are you Shen Mingzhu?

00:08:34.119 --> 00:08:36.160
An auntie asked me
to give you this umbrella.

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:37.440
Who?

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:39.359
She said her surname is Yu.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.359
Who is that?

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:49.080
A distant relative of ours.

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:50.519
Let's go.

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:51.879
Let's go, let's go.

00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:57.560
Mom, wait for me at the entrance.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.440
I'll go get the car.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:58.960
Okay.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.160
(A downpour.)

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.119
(Three mothers are here for me.)

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:30.680
(Though my birth mom is the hidden one.)

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:33.440
(I still feel surrounded by love.)

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.839
(Maternal love is like armor.)

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.239
(In this moment,)

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
(I feel so strong.)

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:42.479
(Strong enough to decide
to become a mother.)

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.040
(I will give birth to this child.)

00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:46.839
(Jianqi's child,)

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:49.119
(but more importantly, mine.)

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.280
Oh, right,

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:57.960
how were the check-up results?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.440
Very good.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.119
The baby is healthy.

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:08.239
I've decided to give birth
to this child.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.359
When he is born,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.639
I'll be the mother,
you'll be the grandma.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.519
From now on, we'll be a real family.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.960
Thank you.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:39.040
It's okay, Mom.

00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:49.320
I'm a grandma now.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.440
This is me.

00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:05.759
It must be right after

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.040
my parents adopted me.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.719
Adorable.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.519
You're so lovely.

00:11:14.719 --> 00:11:16.160
You and Jianqi are both good-looking.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.800
Your baby will surely be beautiful too.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.800
Are you really ready?

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.639
I'm ready.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.200
I haven't thought about anyone else.

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:26.280
I want to give birth to him myself.

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:28.680
I feel like

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:31.119
he is a gift from heaven to me.

00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:35.160
A chance for me to restart my life.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:37.879
Fine.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.080
The biological mom is ready,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.400
the godmother is ready too.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.999
Have you prepared a big red packet?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.280
I'll save up for a big one!

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:47.080
A big one.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.320
This is cute too.

00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:56.200
How about this?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.839
This is our shop's highlight too.

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:02.440
Feng Meiqi.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.400
Come, take a look.

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:07.200
So cute.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.119
Look.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.879
You can hold the wheel.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:12.080
So cute.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.960
Look.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.479
There are fruits.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.519
It's great.

Zhixia.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.320
I'm ordering milk tea.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.239
Do you want one?

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:18.599
I'm pregnant.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.040
I almost forgot.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.040
Let me check this app.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.700
(Does anyone drink milk tea
during pregnancy?)

00:13:26.359 --> 00:13:28.320
It really advises
not to drink that much.

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.080
You have all the apps.

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:32.119
Of course.

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:33.680
But milk should be okay.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.519
I'll get you one.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:36.119
No, thanks. Can't afford that.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.400
It's okay. My treat.

00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:40.400
Maodou.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.280
Is the salary you earn here

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.140
enough for you to drink milk tea
every month?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.160
I don't need a raise.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080
My mom told me

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.280
the most important thing
about working is being happy.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.560
You're happy.

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:56.519
Eating snacks while working.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.239
Did you go to Castilla?

00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:05.119
Of course.

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:07.320
Look how much info I brought back.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.060
They want to have an internal bidding
for their promotion month.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.920
Is it so competitive now?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.920
It used to be only big brands
that did this.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:16.479
Zhixia,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.759
our company only has two people total,

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.639
but we call ourselves
a professional team.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.999
Why can't Castilla

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:24.800
call itself a big brand?

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.440
True.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.479
I need to figure out
how to write the tender.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:33.560
Maodou.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.639
Go to Castilla

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:38.200
and buy me
every shade of lipstick they have.

00:14:38.359 --> 00:14:40.080
I need to understand this product.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:40.960
Zhixia,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.879
with your dedication,

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:46.040
you alone are worth a professional team.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.320
Of course. Earning money is hard now.

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:50.759
I'd hate to spend money
hiring a third person.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.440
You have to work hard!

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.080
Okay.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.960
Then I'll aim to be worth
half a professional team!

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.839
Buy baby bok choy.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.519
Baby bok choy

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:11.920
and chicken.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.320
Soft-shell turtle.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.200
Right, soft-shell turtle is nutritious.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.800
We still have beef

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.519
and jujube from Zhixia.

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:25.680
Bring them all.

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:26.999
And then...

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:29.839
Dacheng.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.960
Hurry, wake up!

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.719
We have to go to the morning market
for fresh food.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:37.440
We're going to Shen's place
to deliver food to Zhilu.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.080
I wonder what kind of food

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.930
- she likes.
- Yu Jingxiang.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.800
Let me remind you.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.280
Stop calling her Zhilu.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.119
She has a name.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:53.160
Shen Mingzhu.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:56.119
It sounds bad if Mr. Shen hears it.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.239
Fine, Mingzhu. Shen Mingzhu.

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:02.200
No, skip the Shen.

00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:06.599
Mingzhu.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.839
Mingzhu.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.999
Xiang.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.080
Xiang.

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:25.119
What is it?

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:26.280
Look.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.599
- What is it?
- Li gave us.

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:30.719
What for?

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:33.400
For pregnant women
to clear heat and detoxify.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.839
Right!

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.960
The Shen family has a big yard.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.119
It's perfect for raising it!

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:40.239
Hurry up, we need to go!

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:40.960
Right away,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.080
I'll find a box!

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:44.639
Oh, right, the jujubes
are on that shelf.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.479
Zhixia brought them over the other day.

00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:47.560
- Okay.
- For replenishing blood and energy.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.119
Okay, got it, got it!

00:16:49.119 --> 00:16:49.560
Okay.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.999
And find me a big bag

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:52.599
to put all this stuff in.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.280
Okay, got it.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.320
Where did the chicken and goose
come from?

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:01.759
Mom, they are alive.

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:04.400
- What happened?
- Don't shout!

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:05.799
This is a goose that lays eggs.

00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:07.640
If you scare it, it won't lay eggs!

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:07.999
Right.

00:17:07.999 --> 00:17:09.740
But I've been afraid of these
since I was little.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.799
Where did they come from?

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:12.799
Oh, this is from Li.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.120
He gave it to your father.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:14.750
Your father said

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.999
goose eggs are the most nourishing
for pregnant women.

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:17.880
Hurry, hurry!

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.400
Is the chicken for my eldest sister?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.200
It's for your second sister.

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:22.920
My eldest sister is pregnant too.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.479
She doesn't have a yard at her house.

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.799
She can't raise it.

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:28.039
Yes.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:28.559
You know it.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.719
Alright, hurry up!

00:17:29.719 --> 00:17:31.440
Okay, fine.

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:33.360
You are delivering them now!

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.120
Yes.

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:34.999
Hold on tight.

00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:35.880
Yes, we're leaving now.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.400
Wait.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.680
It's almost dinner time.
What are we eating tonight?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.759
There are buns in the fridge.

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:41.680
You can heat them up.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.920
I don't want to eat buns.

00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:44.319
Well then,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.039
order takeout.

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:48.920
Didn't you say takeout
is unhealthy and expensive?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.960
Then...

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.319
If you don't eat, you don't eat.

00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:52.840
You won't starve by missing one meal.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.600
Alright, hurry up!

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:53.960
Okay.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.640
How about this?
Wait for me to come home.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.160
I'll make dinner for you
when I get back! I'm leaving now!

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:00.519
So biased.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.559
They are here.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.680
They are here.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.400
Mr. Shen.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.440
Did you wait long?

00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:23.640
Not at all.

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:26.279
Your wife still doesn't know, right?

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.559
We'll slowly ease her into it.

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:28.960
Right.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.079
Take it easy.

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:31.880
You.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.640
What is it?

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.640
Last time, you delivered this umbrella.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.039
My wife found out.

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:39.039
Is she mad?

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.120
What did she say?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.319
Well, she wasn't mad.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.120
When she heard Mingzhu is having a baby,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.719
she became happy.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.239
We are happy too.

00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:51.360
Having a child is a wonderful thing.

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.999
Right, Mingzhu.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.160
How is she? Is she all good?

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.400
She is fine.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.920
Now no one

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.120
is gossiping anymore.

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:01.799
She's in a great mood.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.079
Her prenatal check-up was smooth.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.680
Yes, you are here for her.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.400
Oh, how about

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.759
her in-laws' family?

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.920
Well, her in-laws...

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.400
What does this have to do
with her in-laws?

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:12.880
Well...

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.999
Mingzhu has two families now.

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:16.750
With so many of us,
so many pairs of hands,

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.200
can't we raise a little baby?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.519
Yes, we definitely can.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:20.559
I'm telling you,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.519
this big goose

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.160
lays one egg a day.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.759
Yes.

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:25.440
Lay egg.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.800
You can make soup for Mingzhu

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.440
or steamed custard,
it's very nourishing.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.239
Yes.

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:30.880
Bring it over.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.050
Yes.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.960
Also, we buy a soft-shell turtle.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.799
Make some soup.

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:34.999
Why did you buy so much food?

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:35.319
Exactly.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:38.079
I also made this beef stew for her.

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:39.600
And the jujubes.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.519
Boil some soup for the baby.

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:43.279
We run a restaurant.

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:44.519
No need to buy so much food.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:45.960
We have everything.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.519
This is our token of affection.

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:48.479
Exactly.

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:49.999
Put it in the motorbike!

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.319
Don't put it in the motorbike.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.880
You guys take this motorbike.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.759
Mingzhu likes it. You can keep it.

00:19:57.759 --> 00:19:58.479
Ya.

00:19:58.479 --> 00:19:59.840
I can't.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.079
My wife will think I'm a spy,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.840
colluding with you.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.719
That's true.

00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:07.799
Then you have to carry this.

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.440
Slowly.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.880
Don't let the turtle bite you.

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.680
Hold it. Yes.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.400
It lays egg.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.840
- The umbrella.
- It lays egg.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.719
And this one. Hold it.

00:20:16.239 --> 00:20:17.319
We run a restaurant.

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.160
Look at all these.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.960
This lays egg too?

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.079
Yes.

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:21.160
They all lay eggs.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.880
Now go.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.759
So your wife doesn't really
think you're a spy!

00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:24.239
Yes.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.079
Go home.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.239
Zhixia.

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:34.239
Why are you here?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.960
Hao's workplace gave him apples.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.079
I brought some for you.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.880
Why are you only eating this?

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.039
Just like Hao.

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:41.920
I have no food to eat.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.960
Where are Mom and Dad?

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.680
They're not here.

00:20:45.719 --> 00:20:46.640
Where are they?

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:48.319
Don't even start.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.400
You bring good things home

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:52.600
but them?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.200
They send good things out.

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:56.960
Today, they got a big
and alive white goose.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960
They said it lays eggs.

00:20:58.319 --> 00:20:59.840
And a chicken, and a soft-shell turtle.

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:02.600
They went to deliver "warmth"
to that sister.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.759
They're not even tired,
traveling that far.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.440
I work all day
and come back to no dinner.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.120
You have the nerve to complain,
Xu Zhidong?

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.440
You're a grown man,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.960
still expecting Mom and Dad to cook.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.319
If you have this free time,

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:16.759
use your brain to figure out

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:18.519
how to get them back.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.440
You're so dumb!

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.479
Zhixia, let's order takeout.

00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:27.239
This is nourishing.

00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:28.360
It's for my daughter.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.640
No one touches it!

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.519
Don't touch it.

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:32.360
You're quick.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.680
I'm just helping my sister open the lid.
I'm not eating it.

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:36.279
Hello! You guys are busy.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.400
Hey, why are you guys here?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.239
Haven't eaten yet?

00:21:39.239 --> 00:21:40.200
Yeah, we are about to eat.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.400
Sit down. Let's eat together.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.600
We've eaten.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.640
We just came to visit Mingzhu.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.559
Of course.

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:45.999
Come.

00:21:45.999 --> 00:21:47.079
Put it down.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:47.799
What is it?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.239
This is fish maw and sea cucumber

00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:52.999
that Feng bought for Mingzhu
on his business trip to Guangzhou.

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:54.759
Our daughter is so lucky!

00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:55.600
Thank you, Feng.

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:56.600
Thanks, Dad.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.039
Don't mention it. We're family.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.160
Cigarette?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.840
Yes, sure.

00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:00.840
No way.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:02.600
Mingzhu is pregnant.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.680
You're right.

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:06.079
Recently, Feng is back

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:07.640
to sales again.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.519
He's very busy with company matters.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.319
Look, when a person is busy,
they look good.

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:12.960
- Look at him.
- True.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.279
Right.

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:14.559
You look good.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.360
Thanks for Mingzhu.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.880
She's given our family hope.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.719
Dad, Mom, please sit and chat.

00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:20.360
Right.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:20.799
Yes, have a seat.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:21.600
Please sit.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.160
Please.

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:23.960
Our Mingzhu is definitely

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.840
a great blessing.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.600
She brings fortune
to her mother's family,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.920
and fortune to her husband's family.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.079
People say when she walks by,

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:31.440
even the grass thrives.

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:37.319
One more cup.

00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:38.640
No, it's okay.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.519
Mingzhu, I want to
discuss something with you.

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:44.799
What is it?

00:22:44.999 --> 00:22:47.759
We were wondering if you should
move your household registration

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:49.160
to the new house soon.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.450
The Experimental Elementary School
is right by the house.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.840
It saves a lot of trouble

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.640
when the child starts school.

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:57.559
Thank you, Dad.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.759
It's a good thing, right?

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.999
Feng is so thoughtful.

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:03.600
Yes, thoughtful.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.400
True.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.079
Do you need to

00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:07.719
switch to an easier job?

00:23:08.239 --> 00:23:09.519
Just talk to Mr. Zhao.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.960
I've already spoken to him.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.680
No need.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.719
My job is quite relaxed, actually.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.799
Mr. Zhao takes great care of me.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.079
I plan to go back to work
in a couple of days.

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:18.880
No!

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.920
You can't go back to work.

00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:23.960
You're pregnant.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.450
Going back to work for a change of
environment is good.

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:28.360
We all need to

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.840
start over again in life.

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.559
Am I right?

00:23:31.999 --> 00:23:32.799
Exactly.

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:40.079
Okay, everything is ready.

00:23:42.239 --> 00:23:43.799
The burnt ribs.

00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:45.200
I'll destroy the evidence.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.239
Go, go, go!

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.279
We have to go all the way with this act!

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.840
Will they believe we actually made this?

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.950
I don't care if they believe it or not
right now!

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:01.319
Right now,

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:03.239
I have to save myself!

00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:05.840
That sister is nice,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.640
but the children at home
are more important!

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.680
When are your parents
going to meet mine?

00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.860
I'm truly sorry
for all this trouble recently.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.360
But look at them.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.960
Just let them be crazy.

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:20.160
I always believe

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.450
that life will eventually return
to its peaceful routine.

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:24.719
My family is poor,

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:27.920
but my parents are people of integrity.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.479
I know.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.559
Seeing how much your parents
care about your sister,

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:33.640
I know they're loving
and righteous people.

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.719
I've already told my mom.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.120
I told her

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.559
I definitely won't get rich
marrying you,

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:44.200
but our life will be happy.

00:24:44.239 --> 00:24:45.559
Of course.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.479
Dacheng, what do you want
for dinner tonight?

00:24:51.479 --> 00:24:52.239
They are home.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.759
Shredded pork
and preserved vegetable noodles.

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:54.319
No, I don't know yet.

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:54.960
Just make some noodle.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.920
Where is Zhidong?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.920
Just cook some noodles. Keep it simple.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.880
I'm starving.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.799
Welcome, two distinguished guests.

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:02.880
Uncle and Auntie, hello.

00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:05.160
Bichen, you're here.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.279
Bichen, we've been very busy recently

00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:11.039
and haven't paid attention to you.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.519
It's okay.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.279
You must be hungry.

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.360
I'll cook.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.160
Go.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.740
- Mom.
- Okay.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.479
No need.

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.120
Look.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.200
Who made it? You made it?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.999
We made it. We learned it online.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.600
Come, Dad, please sit.

00:25:30.719 --> 00:25:32.039
Please sit.

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:32.559
Oh my.

00:25:33.079 --> 00:25:33.840
Please sit.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.360
This is unbelievable.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:35.880
The fish.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.680
- Come.
- The fish.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.200
It's nicely sliced.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.600
Look at this oil-braised shrimp.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:39.960
Exactly.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.200
Uncle, I'll pour you some liquor.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.960
Thank you, Bichen.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.920
Look at Bichen.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.400
Thank you so much.

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:47.799
I'm so embarrassed
that I made you come here to cook.

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:48.880
So sorry.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.640
Don't mention it.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640
Thank you.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.120
Dad, Mom.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.810
I want to say a few words.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.640
Today is a good day for our family.

00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:04.279
A memorable day.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.640
Your son has no other way to repay you,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.479
so I've prepared
some simple food for you two.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.519
Thank you son.

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:12.960
Cheers.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.319
Bichen, thank you.

00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:16.039
Thank you, son.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.719
Taste it.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.559
Try it.

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:22.680
Uncle, try the shrimp.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:22.999
Sure.

00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:24.360
- Mom, here you go.
- Let's try.

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:25.559
Shrimp.

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:26.840
Please give us feedback.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.920
It smells so good, Bichen.

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:37.960
It's just like something a master chef

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.920
at a big restaurant would make.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.640
This is so much better.

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:43.719
Great cooking skills.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.319
Did you notice?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.039
Our son has grown up.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.039
He knows how to care about others.

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.239
Exactly.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.799
Not really.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.239
Chen cooked everything.

00:26:57.239 --> 00:26:58.400
I just helped out.

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.519
I did fry the greens.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.640
I think,

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:05.840
regardless of whose effort it is,

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.680
it's the result of
the parents' education.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.120
Yes.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.759
Correct.

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.239
Zhidong, Bichen.

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:13.360
Recently,

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.440
we are quite busy. Right?

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:15.880
Yes.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.120
From now on, you two will be
in charge of making dinner.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.719
They have to work.

00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:23.559
Come on.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.559
Let's cheer!

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:25.239
Uncle.

00:27:25.239 --> 00:27:25.880
That's a deal.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.260
We waited too long just now.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.120
The food seems a bit cold.
I'll go heat it up.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.719
- No need.
- I can heat it up.

00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:31.759
- No need.
- I can do it.

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:33.680
- No, I'll go. Just leave it to me.
- Bichen.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.479
Uncle.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.519
- Good cooking skills.
- Thank you for your hard work.

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:38.200
Not at all.
It's what I should do, Auntie.

00:27:38.479 --> 00:27:39.279
Miss Xu,

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:42.160
are you helping me or hurting me?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.440
Dad just said Chen and I

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.160
have to cook all the meals
moving forward.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.279
Miss Xu,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.319
are you helping me or hurting me?

00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:03.559
Dad just said Chen and I

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.279
have to cook all the meals
moving forward.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.680
If you're slow, don't blame me.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.519
A biological sister just dropped
from the sky.

00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:16.160
Let's just pray for ourselves.

00:28:25.999 --> 00:28:27.519
If you can't write, don't write.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.479
Take a break.

00:28:28.479 --> 00:28:30.340
It took you seven days
to write six characters.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.319
My title is more than six words.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.519
It's a metaphor.

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:40.840
Hand me a tissue.

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:45.880
Tissue!

00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:53.319
I didn't notice when we were busy

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:54.680
looking for her.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.880
Now that she is found,

00:28:58.039 --> 00:28:59.799
the problems are everywhere.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.479
What do you mean?

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:07.640
We have to visit on holidays, right?

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.200
Should we give a red packet

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.319
when Shen Mingzhu has a baby?

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:15.559
You're having a baby too.

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:16.479
It's offset.

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:18.960
Should we give a white packet
since her husband dies?

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.319
Of course.

00:29:20.719 --> 00:29:22.440
Your husband is still alive.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.319
You don't get it.

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:25.120
My parents

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.880
are out all day recently.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.479
Sending love everyday.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.479
Shen Mingzhu.

00:29:31.239 --> 00:29:32.519
Shen Mingzhu.

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:35.999
She's the precious pearl of
the Shen family.

00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:38.680
Does she need our family's
little bit of love?

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:40.880
If they want to send it, let them.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.910
They haven't seen each other
for so many years.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.999
What's wrong with sending some love?

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:45.560
They can send it as much as they want.

00:29:45.999 --> 00:29:47.200
My mom, too.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.319
I'm pregnant too.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.400
I'm her biological daughter, too.

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:52.960
When I was pregnant with Jiao,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.590
she brought me chicken soup, fish soup,
and turtle soup every day.

00:29:55.759 --> 00:29:57.440
Since she found my younger sister,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.920
I haven't get anything.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.600
They are still making the soup.

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:06.840
But they send it to someone else.

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:10.920
Are you starting a fight?

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.759
Dad, I don't know how to solve this.

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:15.120
Teach me!

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.680
Leave it blank first.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.680
Go.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.840
I haven't finished talking!

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:22.200
I have a few. Come here quickly!

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:24.039
Go.

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:25.600
Coming.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.239
Let me teach her.

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:30.519
What's the rush!

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:31.479
Hurry up!

00:30:31.479 --> 00:30:32.200
Coming!

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.120
So what's the answer?

00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:38.120
1500 kilometers per hour.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.880
Ming's grandma speed is

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.600
1500 kilometers per hour.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.239
Is she flying?

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:45.600
Hao, open the door.

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:46.799
Coming.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.250
Continue solving the questions.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.279
It's your mother.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.039
She is sending you love.
Should I open the door?

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.440
No.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.160
Fine.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.479
Mum, you're here.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.440
Zhang Hao.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.200
Where is Zhixia?

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.840
Zhixia.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.360
Where is Jiao?

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.079
Doing homework.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:17.120
Here.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.120
I bought her corn roll.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.640
Okay.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.799
Zhixia.

00:31:22.719 --> 00:31:24.559
You finally remembered me.

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:27.039
Why wouldn't I remember you?

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:28.239
Not only did I remember you,

00:31:28.239 --> 00:31:30.559
look what I brought you.

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:35.079
Oil-braised shrimp
that your brother made.

00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:36.360
Here you go.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.759
No soup today?

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:45.600
Whether my brother made it himself

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.920
or pretended to make it,

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.200
as long as you think of me,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.400
I'm content.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.120
You are my eldest daughter.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.039
How could I forget you?

00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:58.719
Isn't that right, Zhang Hao?

00:31:58.719 --> 00:32:00.960
Exactly. Mom thinks about you every day.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.960
Exactly. Where is Jiao?

00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:04.120
She is doing homework.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.319
Alright.

00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:06.479
- Give it to her later.
- Sure.

00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:07.559
Have a chat.

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:08.440
Okay.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.200
Try it.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.960
It smells quite good.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.440
That means it's good.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.920
Well,

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.759
I only ate one,

00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:22.279
and I couldn't bear to eat any more.

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:23.999
I brought it to my eldest daughter.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.600
You haven't eaten any? No way.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.360
- Eat it.
- You eat it.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:29.840
Look.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.880
I peeled this one.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.079
Wait, let me see.

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.120
What's wrong with your feet?

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.960
Why do they look swollen?

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:37.079
I don't know.

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:39.370
You're at first trimester only.
Why are your feet swollen?

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.039
I can't fit into my old shoes anymore.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.440
Why is it swollen?

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.600
Oh my.

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.239
I'm fine.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.719
Are you...

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:52.519
Is it a calcium deficiency?

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.400
I remember your feet only swelled

00:32:57.319 --> 00:32:59.759
when you were eight
or nine months pregnant with Jiao.

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:01.440
Does it hurt?

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.400
No pain, no itch. It's fine.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.719
My Zhixia.

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:08.920
You're strong.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.239
Luckily, your little sister

00:33:12.239 --> 00:33:13.600
has no reaction.

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:19.999
What do you mean?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.600
What?

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.039
I deserve to have swollen feet,

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.759
but my sister must be safe and sound.

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:27.239
No.

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:29.559
No, how could you say that?

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:31.960
Why are you saying things like this?

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.120
Don't be so anxious.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.640
Why are you so quick-tempered?

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.840
I just make a remark.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.559
What I'm trying to say is,

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.519
your little sister

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:41.079
has already suffered enough.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.160
She can't have anything else
happen to her now.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.319
No one can have anything happen to them.

00:33:44.319 --> 00:33:44.559
Right.

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:45.519
I have parents and children.

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:47.680
- I can't have anything happen to me.
- Yes, you're right.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.920
You'll be safe and sound.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.680
Safe and sound.

00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:52.319
Safe and sound.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.600
Zhixia, you are considered

00:33:56.759 --> 00:33:58.400
advanced maternal age.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.079
You must take care of yourself.

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.519
Don't tire yourself out.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.160
Rest when you should.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.120
If you need anything,

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:07.279
ask Zhang Hao to do it.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.840
He already does enough.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.639
Softer.

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:30.720
Zhixia,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.360
what supplements

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.559
did you take this pregnancy?

00:34:38.479 --> 00:34:40.599
Buy an extra set for your sister.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.079
Who's paying?

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:46.360
Money again.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.679
Why do you always talk about money
when this comes up?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.039
Can sisterly affection be measured
with money?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.679
My surname is Xu, her surname is Shen.

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.679
Thanks to you and Dad,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.760
I'm forcing a relationship with her.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.199
Isn't my warm approach
met with cold shoulder enough?

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.320
And you talk about sisterly affection!

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.840
There's no sisterly affection
between us.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.479
I'm not close with her at all,
okay?

00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:11.920
Whether you're close or not,
she is your biological sister.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.519
Right?

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:15.720
Born of the same father and mother.

00:35:15.999 --> 00:35:17.280
The same root and origin.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.440
Came out of the same mother.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.280
Right? Even if you don't admit it,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.360
you can't escape it.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.159
You

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:36.960
were the first child.

00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:39.400
When you were born,

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.999
your father and I were still young.

00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:44.199
No one helped us then.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.479
Just the two of us raised you.

00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:49.920
At that time,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.800
you were very, very unhealthy.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.599
We were constantly
rushing to the hospital.

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.370
Sometimes your dad and I

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.360
would ride our bicycle
in the middle of the night,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.639
taking you to the children's hospital
to see a doctor.

00:36:00.519 --> 00:36:02.639
Later,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.880
you got eczema and went to visit
a traditional Chinese physician.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.159
You took traditional medicine,

00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:09.599
had acupuncture, and massage.

00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:13.360
Your health was finally regulated.

00:36:17.639 --> 00:36:19.240
If your health when you were little

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.320
was as strong as it is now,

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440
your grandmother

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.599
probably wouldn't have given
the little girl away.

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:28.960
They should have sent me away.

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:31.360
That's not what I mean.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.999
What's wrong with you?

00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:35.519
Why is your temper
so fiery all the time?

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:36.800
That's not good.

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:39.260
Go to traditional Chinese physician
and take medicine.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.720
Oh, right.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.720
You can't take Chinese medicine
while pregnant.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.400
Let's regulate it with food.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.039
We try to work it out with your food.

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:48.679
You can't walk around barefoot.

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:50.240
Or you'll get sick easily.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:50.880
Mom.

00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:53.760
Stop nagging.

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.760
I'll be honest.

00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:58.760
I haven't bought any supplements
this pregnancy.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.320
I...

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.240
I bought.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.400
I bought this.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.519
I bought this one thing.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.679
18.8 yuan.

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:08.280
Do you want it?

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.119
You want it. Take it.

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:10.519
Send it to your youngest daughter.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.760
Why?

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.240
Why didn't you buy supplements?

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:19.400
I remember you bought them
when you were pregnant with Jiao.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.079
Right.

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:22.800
Because you paid for it back then.

00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:25.039
If you pay for it now, I'll buy it.

00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:27.720
Right.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.720
But now I'm struggling financially.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.880
Zhixia.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.440
You are the eldest daughter.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.960
You have to look
at the big picture, right?

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.159
Your brother is getting married.

00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:44.159
Your sister is pregnant.

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:44.559
Of course,

00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:45.760
you are pregnant too.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.240
But you're living a good life.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.760
If you don't contribute, who will?

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.079
If you don't help, who will?

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:51.119
Mom, so, having children

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.830
is about robbing the rich
to help the poor.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.360
- No.
- The big sister gets unlucky!

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.100
Whoever is living a good life
has to suffer losses.

00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:58.039
Mom, I'm pregnant.

00:37:58.039 --> 00:37:58.999
My legs are swollen.

00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:01.039
I can't afford to buy myself
a good pair of shoes.

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:02.880
Why don't my brother and sister
think about helping me?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.119
- What happened?
- No, you...

00:38:04.519 --> 00:38:05.720
- You are...
- What happened?

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.880
Why did you start fighting
all of a sudden?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.679
Zhixia, you can't talk to Mom like that.

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:10.559
Right.

00:38:10.559 --> 00:38:11.800
Look, Zhang Hao said it too.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.960
You can't talk to me

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.039
like that, right?

00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:16.360
What do you want?

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.159
Do you want your brother and sister

00:38:18.159 --> 00:38:19.720
to help you?

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.410
That's why I said

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.519
that you should have send me away
in the first place.

00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:24.800
Let Shen Mingzhu
be the eldest daughter in the family.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.760
Right? Her in-laws' family is rich.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.280
Bird nest, shark fin, abalone.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.440
She gets everything.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.880
She could also

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.360
help Xu Zhidong.

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:35.320
How could you say that?

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.559
Am I wrong?

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.280
Since you found this Shen Mingzhu,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.180
have you ever treated me
like your daughter?

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:40.479
You...

00:38:40.479 --> 00:38:41.440
Ever since I'm pregnant,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.610
the only thing you've given me

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.999
is this tiny piece of chocolate
you took from Grandma's grave!

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:45.519
You...

00:38:45.519 --> 00:38:46.679
Oh, right.

00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:47.920
And that shrimp.

00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:49.960
That was takeout
that Xu Zhidong ordered!

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.360
No.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.960
He made it himself.

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:55.820
I don't care where it comes from.

00:38:56.479 --> 00:38:57.720
It is from Xu Zhidong.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.320
Not from you.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.639
But I'm thinking about you.

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:01.599
I send it to you.

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:04.039
Am I wrong?

00:39:04.039 --> 00:39:05.280
Are you thinking about it?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.400
Why did you bring it?

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.679
You used bringing it as an excuse

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:08.720
to morally pressure me

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.280
into buying supplements
for the daughter you just found!

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.400
Can't you buy them?

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.840
No!

00:39:17.999 --> 00:39:20.400
You gave birth to Shen Mingzhu, not me!

00:39:24.679 --> 00:39:26.479
Mom, what happened?

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:29.280
I'm sorry, Jiao.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.920
I forgot you're at home.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:31.960
Jiao.

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:34.280
We were just talking.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.440
Jiao, I'll help you with your homework.

00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:37.240
I'll do it.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.960
I gave birth to her, I'll do it.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.039
Let's go.
I'll help you with your homework.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.039
Mom, please sit.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280
I'll cook.

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:52.400
I'll make you soup.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.159
I'll pretend...

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.599
I'll pretend that I never give birth
to that daughter.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.320
Ten months of pregnancy.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.280
Ten months of pregnancy.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.479
I gave birth to a dog!

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:12.679
You want me to ask my little daughter

00:40:12.679 --> 00:40:13.920
for this and that?

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.360
Why should I ask her?

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.960
I didn't raise her.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.479
Do I have the right to ask her?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.280
All of them are just ungrateful.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.840
Fine. You've been talking all morning.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.119
Rest for a while.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.079
Rest? Why would I rest?

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.360
Why do I need to rest?

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:35.240
I'm telling you, Xu Dacheng.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.559
This is all because I married you!

00:40:37.559 --> 00:40:38.800
What are you gesturing at?

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:42.240
If it weren't for you,
would this family be like this?

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:42.999
What good did I get

00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:44.960
from marrying you?

00:40:45.999 --> 00:40:47.119
I don't eat well,

00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:48.240
I don't drink well.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.720
I manage this home.

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:51.960
My little daughter

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:54.199
doesn't know our good intentions.

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:56.360
And my children at home

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.079
are ungrateful!

00:40:59.079 --> 00:40:59.720
Mom.

00:41:01.039 --> 00:41:02.559
How am I ungrateful?

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:04.199
Aren't you ungrateful?

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.920
Aren't you ungrateful?

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:07.559
Think about it.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.119
Since you were little,

00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:11.119
didn't you get
all the good food at home?

00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:15.119
You drank breast milk
until you were two.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.800
That's why you're so strong and sturdy.

00:41:18.159 --> 00:41:18.800
Also,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.479
you complained that school was far,

00:41:20.679 --> 00:41:22.639
so your dad picked you up
and dropped you off.

00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:24.039
When your school had a cleaning day,

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:25.320
your grandmother and I

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.960
carried brooms

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.639
to clean for you.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.519
Xu Zhidong,

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.999
do you need to repay
your parents' kindness?

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.720
Yes. I'll change my name to Xu Zhi'en.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.760
Seek to repay.

00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:40.440
You...

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.599
I've repaid it!

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.320
Didn't I cook for you?

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.679
Zhixia said

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:47.240
that was takeout you ordered.

00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:50.440
Zhixia said this?

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.159
Yes.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.039
My sister is the ungrateful one!

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.340
You can't talk about
your big sister like that.

00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.679
Zhixia has contributed the most
to this family!

00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:05.440
A daughter who marries out

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.800
is like water spilled out.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.519
You can't follow her example.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.519
Enough.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.320
The daughter we sent away
hasn't been brought back yet.

00:42:14.519 --> 00:42:16.960
Don't offend the daughters we have
at home.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.159
Offend.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.559
Already offended.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.840
I won't talk to Xu Zhixia anymore.

00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:26.880
Son,

00:42:27.119 --> 00:42:28.400
tell Bichen,

00:42:28.639 --> 00:42:29.639
that once she marries in,

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.960
I'll treat her

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.440
like my own daughter.

00:42:32.679 --> 00:42:33.840
Okay, Mom.

00:42:35.079 --> 00:42:36.800
Then when will you and Dad

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.240
meet Bichen's parents?
