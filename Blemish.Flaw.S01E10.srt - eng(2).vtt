00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.480
I'm sure I can find...

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.079
Wei.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.599
Wei?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.480
Big Hui.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.879
Wei.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.799
It's really you.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.760
Stay away from me.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.439
We broke up.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:07.560
Show some respect.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.280
This is great.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:12.360
You're okay.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.560
You're alive.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.159
Are you crazy?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.199
Should I be dead?

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.039
No.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.560
I've been

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.960
looking for you these days,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.000
but I haven't found a trace of you.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.159
I was worried.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.280
Liu Wei?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.800
She is Liu Wei?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.759
And who are you?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.759
I'm Li De,

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.919
a police officer.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.759
Big Hui has been

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.080
asking me to help

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.719
find you.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.639
He was

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.479
worried about you.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.199
Yang Zhenghui,

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.280
why are you so petty?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.120
I'm sorry I dumped you.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.680
But you wanted me dead?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.520
No.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.400
You got me wrong.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.319
It suddenly occurred to me

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.639
that you vanished from

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.360
all social media

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.560
and video accounts.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:55.680
I got nervous.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.800
I-I was just worried

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.520
about you.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.599
That's true.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.919
He's been worried sick about you.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.759
You guys talk.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.840
Well, thanks.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.439
I changed my accounts.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.319
No more videos or livestreams.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.159
I abandoned my previous accounts

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.120
to cut ties with

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.120
people like you.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.800
I have my own life now.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.800
I'm doing fine.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.680
Stop bothering me.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.199
Okay?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.919
Isn't it for the best?

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.120
Everything is wrong.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.719
What do you mean?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.039
Liu Wei is doing well.

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.280
Your greatest fear

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.960
was confirming

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.919
she was murdered, wasn't it?

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.560
Wei is doing fine.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.159
Of course, I'm happy for her.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.520
But after all my efforts,

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.159
everything turned out wrong.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.919
I'm like a joke.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.960
Do you think you're wrong?

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.280
Do you honestly believe

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.520
Zeng Jie isn't a villain?

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.839
Your phone.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.680
Tracy.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.319
I've been thinking and couldn't

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:31.959
come to another conclusion.

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:33.959
If our deduction

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.920
was right

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.240
and Zeng Jie

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.480
killed Lin Fang and Wei,

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.120
then Bai Xiaoling

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.120
is doomed, too.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.040
Bai Xiaoling

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.879
is worthless

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.079
to Zeng Jie now.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.079
She's a liability.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.040
Why not

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.879
get rid of her?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560
On the other hand,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.120
if I ended up disabled

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:52.319
like Bai Xiaoling,

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.120
with a husband

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.279
partying all day

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.720
and wasting my money

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:56.879
on other women,

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.680
I wouldn't want anything

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.439
other than killing him.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.759
I understand.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.519
The thing women can never forgive

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.920
is betrayal.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.560
Yeah. And being let down.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:28.240
Come on.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.040
What's with the sour face?

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.879
You found Liu Wei. Aren't you happy?

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.600
Yeah, I am.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.160
I'm just surprised.

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.800
What did I say?

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.079
You had no proof.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:41.839
See?

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.040
A slap in the face.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.519
Wei is alive

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:48.759
and she seems

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.040
to be doing better.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:51.720
How do you know?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.879
She wasn't

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.319
wearing any designer brands.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.920
But the fabric quality was decent.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.560
She wore a watch

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.839
at a moderate price.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.680
Most importantly,

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.680
she wasn't screaming for attention.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.040
Nothing was

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.240
worth showing off

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.879
on her Moments.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.160
Her makeup was more subtle.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.759
Compared

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:09.759
to her glamorous

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.560
past self,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.360
she's changed.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.079
But how did you conclude

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.319
that she's doing better

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:15.000
just like that?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.720
She was dressed up

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.879
not for photos,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.839
videos,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.000
or others' approval.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.560
It's like she was genuinely

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.800
styling herself

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.519
in a comfortable way.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.279
She was crossing the street,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.639
having bubble tea.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.519
She looked relaxed.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.959
So,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.720
I'm genuinely happy

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.160
that she's doing better.

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.560
The reason

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.680
why she broke up with me

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680
doesn't matter anymore.

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:43.560
But I'll keep

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.199
investigating Zeng Jie.

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.959
Big Hui.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.680
Whatever happened between

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:50.720
Liu Wei and Zeng Jie

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120
was in the past.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.240
It's not about Liu Wei.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.600
It's about Lin Fang.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.360
I'll keep

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.319
digging into it.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.560
But our top priority is

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.399
Bai Xiaoling.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.600
I didn't know her before

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.959
and only approached her

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.560
for investigation.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.680
Now,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.360
we're like friends.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.439
Besides,

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.720
I make videos

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720
about case analysis.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.480
It's against

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.600
my work ethics

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.399
to let go of suspicious details.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.759
I must respect

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.120
the logic behind truth.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.720
You believe Zhang Xiaohong's claim

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.384
that Bai Xiaoling is in danger?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.319
Think about it.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.439
Bai Xiaoling

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.439
may be disabled,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.240
but she's getting by.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:27.959
Zeng Jie hasn't done

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.959
any harm to her.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.959
Last year's fire at Zeng Jie's studio

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.120
wasn't an accident.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.120
He wanted to burn

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.920
Bai Xiaoling alive.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.759
Enough.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:36.360
Enough.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.399
Trust me.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680
I did trust you before.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.399
Yeah.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.680
I was wrong once,

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.439
but my logic

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.000
is sound.

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:43.399
Yeah.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:45.399
Your reasoning is flawless.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.439
But my stance remains.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.399
We need evidence.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.439
Li De.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.240
Three questions for you.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:55.959
First,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.279
have you suspected

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.399
even for a second

00:07:58.759 --> 00:07:59.279
that Zeng Jie

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360
is a criminal?

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:04.319
Yeah.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.120
But that's not enough.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.560
Okay.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.160
Second,

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.240
have you suspected

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.079
even for a second

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:09.959
that Lin Fang

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.959
didn't drop dead

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.240
by chance?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.240
Nod if you have.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.279
Third,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.759
if I find

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.040
valuable leads

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:21.959
or evidence,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.439
wouldn't you be excited?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.600
That's it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.120
We'll keep investigating.

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:29.879
What do you mean by "we"?

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.480
You think I have nothing

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.360
better to do?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.320
We're buddies now.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.440
Why split hairs?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.200
You're obsessed.

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.080
So obsessed.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:53.600
Who is it?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:54.879
Food delivery.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.480
I didn't order anything.
Wrong address...

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.159
I just couldn't figure out

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.440
how you got involved

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.480
with Bai Xiaoling.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.360
Now, I get it.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.879
You're investigating

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240
Zeng Jie.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.840
W-Who are you?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.000
(Law Firm)
Zhang Ye?

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:18.000
It sounds familiar.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.840
She has an admirer
named Zhang Ye, who keeps

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.919
liking her posts

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.840
and kissing up to her.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.320
I don't think

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.440
he would give up so easily.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:29.960
A lawyer.

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:31.279
Wait.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.600
Why would a lawyer come to me?

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:34.799
A-Am I being sued?

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.080
Come on, chill.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.840
I was just kidding.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.279
Let's be friends.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.399
I-It's not funny.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:42.120
Who's your friend?

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:42.840
You.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:44.799
Big Hui.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.279
Impressive.

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:49.200
As expected of a lawyer.

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.080
What do you want?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.879
Have you eaten?

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.799
Grab a bite with me.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:57.919
I've eaten.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.279
Then have a drink with me.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.000
Those people on your list,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.159
some I know,

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:04.879
some I don't.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.039
If I'm not mistaken,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.919
you're going after

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.679
Zeng Jie.

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.679
To some extent,

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.039
we're allies.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.039
You're quite something,

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:21.039
digging so deep into this

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.559
as a video content creator.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.000
I'm also surprised

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.240
that Zeng Jie had

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.840
done so many things.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.720
Does Bai Xiaoling know
that Zeng Jie is investigating me?

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.039
Yeah, I told her.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.080
What's next?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080
Will you go on?

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:43.399
I want to.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.279
Listen.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.200
You shouldn't

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.080
fight alone anymore.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600
I'll join you.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.720
You're investigating

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.519
two people, right?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.440
Chen Yuhe,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.000
right?

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:58.440
Yeah.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.559
Chen Yuhe has been

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.919
dating Zeng Jie for a while.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.159
She's different.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.399
Zeng Jie won't abandon her

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.320
because she's from

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.120
a wealthy family.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.264
Her dad is Vice President
of Caorong University.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.399
Got it.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.080
He deceives the poor ones
and dumps them.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:15.639
Then he sweet-talks the rich ones.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.279
This guy

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.399
is complete trash.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.200
You said he was seeing

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.200
another rich lady before he got married?

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.080
What happened?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.039
A rich lady

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.200
with a sports car

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.039
was visiting him.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.480
That's all I know.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:29.840
This is like looking for

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.320
a needle in a haystack.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:33.559
Zeng Jie went to Japan
during grad school.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.879
With his financial situation back then,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.000
he couldn't have

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.440
paid for the trip himself.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:41.679
That's easy.

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:42.919
Find out

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.759
who took him

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:44.600
there.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:45.519
I've tried

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:46.879
every possible way

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.279
but found nothing.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.960
Official investigations

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:51.720
require professionals like us.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.360
Leave it

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:54.399
to me.

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:56.159
Mr. Ye,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.679
why are you

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:58.519
so invested?

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:01.639
W-Why are you so invested?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.399
I make

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.639
case analysis videos.

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:04.639
It's my passion.

00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:05.720
Besides,

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:06.879
technically speaking,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.320
I'm unemployed.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.960
I have nothing else to do.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:11.679
But you

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.360
can't be that idle.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600
I...

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:17.639
Come on.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:18.960
Here's to you.

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:22.600
Back then, I focused

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.159
entirely on my career.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.679
Otherwise, how could

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.159
Bai Xiaoling fall for that bad guy

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:29.399
Zeng Jie?

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:32.559
Now she means

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.679
nothing to me.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.279
She's just some girl

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:37.799
I happened to like.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.480
Once

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.320
she divorces Zeng Jie,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.679
I'll make him leave empty-handed.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.039
Then I'll cut ties

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.240
with Bai Xiaoling.

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.799
No more drinks.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.720
I can't...

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:55.080
You're so lousy.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:58.159
Let me get out... I can't...

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.519
Come on, buddy.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:04.639
Listen.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:06.720
I'm telling you.

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:08.559
You must

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.759
look into that bad guy.

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:13.600
Dig deep.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.240
Once you find something,

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:17.240
I'll

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.120
bring him to justice.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.240
Bring him to justice.

00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:25.519
At the very least,

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:28.120
I'll make him leave with nothing.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.960
Yeah...

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:30.200
Yeah.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.320
He wants to
take advantage of Bai Xiaoling?

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.120
Doesn't he know

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.039
who I am?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.120
Who are you?

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.200
Excellent question.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:44.559
To explain who I am,

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:47.080
we must start with humanity's

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.399
relation to the cosmos.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.000
Have a seat.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.440
Want a drink?

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.320
I ordered.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.960
Desserts?

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.632
No, thanks.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.080
Well...

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.879
Zhang Ye

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.399
has approached you.

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:16.120
Yeah.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:18.600
He dragged me out drinking

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:19.639
until midnight.

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:20.440
I'm still dazed.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:21.840
So let's just

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.200
cut to the chase.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.559
I don't have

00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:26.440
any secrets anymore.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.399
I think Mr. Ye

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:29.639
genuinely likes you.

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:30.879
All these years,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.320
he's always cared about you.

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:34.600
"Mr. Ye"?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080
Drinking

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.600
made you buddies.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.840
Not exactly.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.039
But we did get wasted.

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:42.600
I think I puked all over his car.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.200
Enough about him.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.279
Got something to say?

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:47.120
Go ahead.

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.480
Shall we talk somewhere else?

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:57.080
Sure.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.279
You live here?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.159
Yeah.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.360
It's nothing like

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.320
your neighborhood.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.000
I think it's nice.

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.679
I like the vibe here.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.679
Why did you bring me here?

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.679
There's honestly

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:14.679
nothing

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.480
to explain.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.240
I've been

00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:17.600
investigating your husband.

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:18.399
That's why

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:19.639
I approached you.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.759
Your husband

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.799
has done many unspeakable things.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:24.399
Mr. Ye knows

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.320
and offers to handle your case

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:27.480
and protect

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.720
your assets.

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:32.360
One more thing.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.639
It may sound ridiculous.

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:37.879
I've been looking for Wei,
suspecting she was dead.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:38.960
But I saw her

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.039
on the street yesterday.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:49.879
She

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.679
told you everything?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.159
I was surprised to see her.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.559
I blurted out,

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:57.519
"You're alive."

00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:58.559
She cursed at me

00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.279
and left.

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:01.759
Didn't you talk about

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:04.200
why you broke up

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.279
back then?

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.519
No.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.600
She yelled at me and left,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.264
without leaving contact information.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.159
But

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.039
she's alive.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.240
I think she's doing well.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.320
So I can put my mind at ease.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:24.480
Here.

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:44.519
Won't you check it?

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:45.840
Why?

00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:47.559
Want to see how you looked?

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:51.639
I edited it.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.159
I blurred out

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.279
my face.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.480
Did you make backups?

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.240
Would you believe me if I said no?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.559
This stuff

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.759
doesn't benefit me.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.200
We're even now. You can go.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.160
I'll discard the SIM card.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.720
I assume

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:21.759
you won't contact me again.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.680
Happy divorcing.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.200
Why did you come?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.640
Zeng Jie.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.200
There's something

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.839
you should see.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.519
I'll cut to the chase.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:42.880
It's about you

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:44.680
and Liu Wei.

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:51.440
Bai Xiaoling.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.559
I've got something

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.519
you should see, too.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:57.960
It's about you

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.240
and Liu Wei.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:04.880
I secretly recorded a video

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:06.240
when your wife

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.960
came to me.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.640
300,000 yuan extra

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.720
and it's yours.

00:18:15.359 --> 00:18:16.720
Happy divorcing.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.559
Shameless!

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:40.119
You sold me out!

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:41.119
Hypocrite!

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.519
You only wanted evidence

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:43.440
to get a bigger share

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.480
of the assets.

00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:45.200
Liar.

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:47.640
Not a shred of integrity.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.599
A woman

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:51.319
who scams her own husband

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:52.799
is speaking of integrity?

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:55.079
Go ahead and kill me.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:56.359
Or I'll tell everyone

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:57.759
you paid me

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:59.200
to seduce your husband.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.000
Go ahead.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.839
I'll release the video

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.279
of you and Zeng Jie.

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:05.200
Go ahead.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.519
It doesn't even

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.960
show my face.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.200
I don't want trouble.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.079
I just want some money

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.279
and start a new life.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.000
Why won't you let me go?

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.960
Don't provoke me.

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:24.680
And I won't

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.119
expose your dirty secrets.

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:29.359
Someone of your status

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.440
wouldn't want to lose face, right?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.160
I'll say it again.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.720
I don't want trouble.

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:36.880
If you want to fight,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.880
you might not win.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.240
Why did you set me up?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.839
I didn't plan

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.119
to set you up.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.680
I just wanted to do the job

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.839
and leave with the money.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.839
But your husband

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.839
opened up to me about his life.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.119
And I realized we were the same.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.759
No money, no status,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.279
struggling desperately

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:03.559
to live a better life.

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:05.359
The life he's built

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:06.720
wasn't achieved easily.

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:08.519
We're just the same.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.920
So you sold me out

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.000
and took his money.

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:13.480
You just wanted more dirty money.

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:15.200
Why shouldn't I get paid

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:16.480
for doing the job?

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:18.640
I did everything

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.119
you asked me to do.

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:21.319
Why won't you let me go?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.559
What do you want?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.640
You think you're justified?

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.920
How are you justified then?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.519
You hired me

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:32.319
to seduce your husband for money.

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:33.519
We're both bad.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.920
So don't judge me.

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:37.519
Stop bothering me.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.640
Or I'll drag you down with me.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.319
Let's see who breaks first,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.680
you or me.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:44.400
I know very well

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:45.720
why you're getting divorced.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.680
Would that make you look good?

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:50.279
Just let me go

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.279
and I'll vanish.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.000
I was leaving anyway.

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:56.079
You'll

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:57.440
never see me again.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.519
And I want nothing to do

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:00.599
with my current life.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:07.920
Alright.

00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:10.279
Good.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.839
The thing is, it's not about

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.200
Liu Wei,

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.000
but her.

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:21.400
Lin Fang.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.480
I don't know her.

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.960
Nor do I care to hear

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.039
her story.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.079
You have to hear it.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:29.440
She was Zeng Jie's girlfriend

00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:30.799
before he met you.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.680
In fact,

00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:33.319
they held a wedding in the village.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.000
When they were dating,

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:36.079
Zeng Jie worked at

00:21:36.079 --> 00:21:37.359
a village art studio.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720
I know that he copied

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:39.759
Monet paintings

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.960
at the art studio.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.079
Meanwhile, he was also

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.960
seeing another

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.799
rich lady.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.240
(Rich Lady)
I'm investigating her.

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:48.519
She probably

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:49.240
took Zeng Jie

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:50.519
to Japan for fun.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.960
Because he went there
during grad school,

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:53.880
even though

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.440
he didn't have any money.

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.880
I'm going with friends
for the hot springs in Japan.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.759
Come along.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.519
Japan?

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:05.359
Do you have a visa?

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.200
No.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:12.359
Due to

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.640
some unfathomable reasons,

00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:15.240
Zeng Jie didn't marry

00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:16.519
this rich lady.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:17.480
After that,

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.680
he met you.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.559
The timeline I reconstructed

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.279
shows that

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:25.039
(Time for dating and marriage)
he was still with Lin Fang.

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:26.279
When you two

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:27.799
first started dating,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.240
Lin Fang died

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.960
from a sudden heart attack.

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:34.000
Her brother

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:35.119
Lin Shan held the funeral.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.400
But oddly,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.319
no one

00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:38.720
ever saw her remains.

00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:40.119
Lin Shan took her ashes

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.839
back for burial.

00:22:42.599 --> 00:22:43.279
That's why

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.480
I can't determine

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:47.200
how Lin Fang died.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.799
She died four years ago.

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:52.240
Lin Shan hasn't

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:53.200
had any steady job

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:54.039
ever since.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.799
But he kept getting money somehow.

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:58.240
Zhang Xiaohong's hospital bills

00:22:58.279 --> 00:22:59.640
have already cost him

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:00.720
hundreds of thousands.

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:02.440
Who is Zhang Xiaohong?

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.279
(Money, treatment)
Zhang Xiaohong.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.119
Tracy.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.599
She's a bit like you.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.480
She also suffered an accident

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:09.319
that left her unable to walk.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.720
But unlike you,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.640
she's broke

00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:13.240
and confined to her hospital bed.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.039
Regarding Lin Shan, Lin Fang,

00:23:16.119 --> 00:23:16.839
and Zeng Jie,

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.039
she has some

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:19.480
personal insights and theories.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.119
Does Zhang Ye know about

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.519
what you just told me?

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.359
Yeah.

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:38.039
He's probably

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:38.880
investigating

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.039
that mysterious rich lady

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:41.359
and Chen Yuhe.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.920
He's always wanted me

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.119
to get divorced with minimal

00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:44.960
financial loss.

00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:46.079
I think he truly

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.000
cares for you.

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.000
I know.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.279
I'm his unresolved

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:51.200
attachment.

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:53.079
But it's unnecessary.

00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:55.039
I am no longer

00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:56.119
who I used to be.

00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:00.799
But I have another thought.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.279
Think about it.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.240
Was the fire at Zeng Jie's studio

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.480
truly an accident?

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.960
He thought you went

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:20.799
to the third floor to rest.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.160
The fire broke out

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.400
after you left.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.799
It is

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:37.079
quite hard to believe

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:38.279
that Zeng Jie

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:39.359
just happened to have

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.119
the mask and blanket ready.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.359
You survived the fire.

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:50.240
A month later,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.440
you had a car accident.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.640
The brake failed...

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.319
It can't be a coincidence.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.880
You drove a good car.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.440
I consulted some friends

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.279
as car experts.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.839
Someone must have tampered

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.960
with the brake.

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:02.599
It can't all be coincidental.

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:03.599
Bai Xiaoling.

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:04.880
You can choose to

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.480
dismiss these as mere speculations.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.759
But think about it.

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:08.880
Things were awful

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960
between you two.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.319
Wouldn't it benefit him

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:12.759
if you had an accident?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.359
He'd benefit the most.

00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:16.400
Zeng Jie is my husband.

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:17.799
Yang Zhenghui.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.799
I don't like how you diminish

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:20.799
my marriage.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.000
I can tell.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.519
You don't have to like it.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.680
I'm just showing you

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.440
the reality.

00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:27.279
Reality can be cruel.

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:28.519
You can't keep avoiding it.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.480
Bai Xiaoling.

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:30.559
Zhang Ye wants to

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.720
win the case for you.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.599
As for me,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.359
I just want you to stay safe.

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:36.720
You're overthinking.

00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:39.079
You're free to make assumptions

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.000
and deductions,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.880
following your logic.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.200
But trust me.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.640
This isn't the truth.

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:45.559
Big Hui.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.079
I know my marriage

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.039
isn't the most pleasing.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.720
But this is my life.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.960
I want to face it myself.

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:02.640
Zeng Jie is taking me on a trip soon.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.400
He wants to improve

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.400
our relationship.

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:06.624
Where are you going?

00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:07.920
Could it be...

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:09.880
Big Hui.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:11.759
Shouldn't you wish me well?

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:12.960
I do.

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:13.440
But...

00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:14.839
When I'm like this,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.160
it can't get much worse.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.519
If we can mend things,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.000
maybe we'll just continue

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.440
living an ordinary life.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.319
If it truly can't be fixed,

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:25.240
I want a clean ending.

00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:26.440
If I really

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.559
divorce Zeng Jie,

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:29.319
I'll ask Zhang Ye for help.

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:31.599
But don't make decisions

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:32.880
on my behalf.

00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:34.759
Let me be the judge.

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:36.240
So,

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480
I'm looking forward

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480
to this trip.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.920
I used to love traveling.

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:44.799
I also used to

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.079
love Zeng Jie.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.440
Leave it open. Someone might come in.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:17.920
I just love

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.480
how you're full of indecent thoughts

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:21.480
and yet you pretend to be decent.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.640
Why did you come?

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.519
Three things.

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:28.559
First,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.480
I'm meeting friends

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.440
this weekend.

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:33.079
So don't make plans with me.

00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:34.440
Is that the first thing

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.279
or the second?

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:36.200
Second,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.559
I saw

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:38.920
a new restaurant online.

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:39.839
It looks good.

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.640
I'll treat you to dinner.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.599
If you don't want to
hear the third thing,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.640
I won't say it.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:48.079
You can't resist

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.240
telling me.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.400
So just say it.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:51.599
I changed my mind.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.680
I'll tell you

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:53.920
the third thing at dinner.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.200
It seems

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.559
you'll have to wait two more hours.

00:27:59.119 --> 00:27:59.839
It must be tough.

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:07.640
I'll tell you

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.440
the third thing.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:09.240
Professor Zeng.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.079
Go ahead.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.720
I said,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.960
"I'll tell you"

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.039
"the third thing."

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:17.000
"Professor Zeng."

00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:19.759
What?

00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:25.039
Professor Zeng.

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:29.200
You fool.

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.599
You're no longer

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.759
an associate professor.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.480
How do you know?

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.920
The promotion came through?

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:37.960
I heard my dad

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.599
on the phone during dinner

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680
last night.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.279
Maybe

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.599
you heard it wrong.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:47.039
Yeah, maybe.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.160
Maybe, he meant another Zeng Jie?

00:28:55.119 --> 00:28:56.119
No way.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.640
In the entire Caorong,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.000
there's only one Zeng Jie.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.960
Of course, I know that.

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:03.519
I couldn't catch

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:04.240
the other names,

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:05.319
but I heard yours.

00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:06.799
So? Professor Zeng.

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:08.000
Aren't you

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
really proud,

00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:09.880
but trying to

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.119
look discreet?

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.000
Discreet?

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.640
Why do I need to

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.680
be discreet with you?

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.519
Of course, I'm proud.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.319
I was once

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.079
Caorong University's

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:22.279
youngest associate professor.

00:29:23.319 --> 00:29:24.400
But now,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200
I'm Caorong University's

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.000
youngest professor.

00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:35.039
Any plans after dinner?

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:36.279
Professor Zeng.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:38.599
Don't dream about spending a night

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.519
with me right after

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:41.640
receiving a promotion.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.400
Tonight,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.319
we only have dinner.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.240
Okay.

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:49.039
You're the boss.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.480
You haven't dined with your wife

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:53.400
for a while, huh?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.240
Yeah.

00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:00.519
Dining with her is torture.

00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:02.599
Nothing to talk about.

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:04.440
When you were dating,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.799
couldn't you

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:06.960
find topics either?

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:09.599
Back then...

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.880
I forgot.

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:16.559
We just chatted about

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.359
random things.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:19.279
I don't remember.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.240
Fine.

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:21.279
Let's go eat.

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:30.799
(You have no idea)

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.559
(how much I love trains.)

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.559
When I was 11,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.640
I saw a train for the first time.

00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:38.720
A station was built in our town

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.480
with tracks running

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.319
past our village.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.680
I'd often

00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:43.960
wait by the tracks,

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:45.920
sometimes at dawn,

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.279
sometimes at dusk.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.680
When trains approached,

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.319
I'd chase after them.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.079
Because I knew

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.400
they could carry me

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.319
away from that village

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.599
to those unseen

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.720
big cities.

00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:01.119
Trains

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.359
carried my longing

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:06.200
for the mysterious vast world

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:07.160
out there.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640
I first took a train

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.000
to take the exams.

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:14.160
I couldn't get

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.920
a sleeper berth or a seat.

00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:18.680
I stood

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.039
between carriages

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.240
with my backpack.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.920
There was always someone smoking,

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.599
making the air

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.680
hazy with smoke.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.160
Looking back now,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.160
it feels surreal.

00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:38.480
We take arts exams

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:41.039
before the college entrance exams.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.960
That was February.

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.200
It was freezing cold.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.440
I stood in the train.

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:49.559
The windows kept fogging up.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.039
I had to keep wiping them

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.240
to see outside.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.880
I watched the mountains

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:57.559
and wilderness

00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:59.680
transform into farmlands,

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:01.119
villages,

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.640
a single tree,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.119
and grassy fields.

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:08.920
Suddenly, a building emerged.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.720
Then there were

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.720
buildings after buildings

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.960
with lights.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.160
All those roads

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.480
were filled

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:24.319
with endless traffic.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.160
Pressing my face against the glass,
I made a promise,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:31.920
"Caorong,"

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:34.759
"I will be there."

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:37.000
"Caorong,"

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:40.079
"I will stay."

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:45.039
You stayed.

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.359
Isn't it ridiculous?

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.039
A village boy like me

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.480
is sitting across

00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:00.279
a privileged lady

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.279
like you.

00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:04.400
Not at all.

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:06.279
I think you're amazing.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.200
You earned everything

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:09.160
through

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.480
your own efforts.

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:12.359
You're much better than me.

00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:17.200
Back in my village,

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.599
we always hold banquets if a kid gets

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.839
into college.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.920
But when I

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.720
received the acceptance letter,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.160
my father was working far away,

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.119
and I was painting
to collect tuition fees.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.119
We didn't think about celebrating.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.279
During our call,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.319
my dad told me that

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.839
he was celebrating with coworkers,

00:33:37.079 --> 00:33:38.799
and buying drinks for everyone.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.319
Hearing that,

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:41.519
I rushed to a store

00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:42.880
and bought liquor.

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:45.400
A pocket-sized one.

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:47.880
After class,

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.559
I downed it alone

00:33:49.599 --> 00:33:50.559
in the studio.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.480
That was my first time.

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:55.960
I was drunk in minutes.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.720
The room was filled

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.960
with easels everywhere

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.920
and canvases filled with crooked lines.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.400
Yet I watched those

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.119
clumsy brushstrokes

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.199
gradually come alive.

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:19.599
Transforming into clouds.

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:21.199
Clouds colliding with wind.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.440
Wind bringing down rain.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.504
Rain swelling into floods.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:27.280
Floods breaking the levees.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.360
Levees collapsing on swans.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.480
Swans treading on snow.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.559
Snow defying the frost.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.239
Frost cracking open

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.000
the heavens.

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:45.239
Heavens establishing new forms.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:48.679
Forms coexisting in harmony.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.239
Harmony blending light with dust.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:56.519
Dust blinding my vision.

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.519
Vision blurred by arrogance.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.159
I got drunk

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.400
and sobered up.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.559
Then everything changed in my life.

00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:21.400
Professor Zeng,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.239
you were born

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:26.400
to be an artist.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.840
How can you stop them

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.679
from traveling?

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.199
Zeng Jie is up to no good.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.960
Enough.

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:44.760
Stop theorizing.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.119
Bai Xiaoling won't believe you.

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:48.800
She's too involved

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.159
to see clearly.

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:53.000
You theorized

00:35:53.079 --> 00:35:54.239
that Zeng Jie set the fire

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.119
to destroy

00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:56.119
traces of Liu Wei.

00:35:56.239 --> 00:35:57.000
Now, it seems

00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:57.920
he was targeting

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.800
Bai Xiaoling.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.880
The fire broke out

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:01.800
exactly when Liu Wei

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.599
was close to Zeng Jie.

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:04.519
Yeah.

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:06.719
Right.

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:07.960
Ask Wei.

00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:09.679
Not bad, Li De.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.360
You're pro.

00:36:10.639 --> 00:36:11.159
If Liu Wei

00:36:11.239 --> 00:36:12.639
was dating Zeng Jie,

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:13.719
she must

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.760
know something.

00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:15.760
That's right.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:17.960
But

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.199
I can't find her.

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:21.440
Can you trace her?

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.960
I told you

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:23.880
I can't do that.

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:27.360
Big Hui.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.079
You only dated Wei for three months.

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:33.000
You barely knew her.

00:36:34.239 --> 00:36:34.840
Yeah.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.360
Wei might not be her real name.

00:36:37.519 --> 00:36:38.719
It could be an alias.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.599
That makes it even harder.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.599
I also don't know how to find her.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.000
Think outside the box.

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:48.199
Aren't you good at this?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.960
It's Tracy.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.280
Something came up.

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:53.559
Don't forget this.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.159
Hello, Tracy.

00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:56.639
Lin Shan asked Zeng Jie

00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:57.519
for a lot of money.

00:36:57.639 --> 00:36:58.360
A lot of money?

00:36:59.519 --> 00:36:59.960
Yeah.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:01.480
When he brought me

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.599
breakfast earlier,

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.920
he said he would get me

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.119
to a hospital in Shanghai.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.679
You know how it is.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.599
My treatment

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.559
costs over a million.

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:11.000
Why does he suddenly decide to ask
for so much money now?

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:12.159
I'm not sure.

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:13.400
Did you

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.239
uncover something

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.599
that made Zeng Jie nervous?

00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:16.199
Otherwise,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.000
why would he

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:18.159
give Lin Shan so much money?

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.800
I haven't found anything.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.480
Nothing really ties

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:22.079
Zeng Jie

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:23.480
to Lin Fang's death.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.880
This is weird.

00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:28.119
I'm clueless now.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.920
I just wanted to

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.400
inform you.

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:31.280
Got it.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.599
It's fishy.

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:38.559
Did Lin Shan

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.119
get money from

00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:40.760
someone else?

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:41.800
No way.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:43.039
Who else would

00:37:43.039 --> 00:37:43.639
give him money

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:44.440
besides Zeng Jie?

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:51.440
Who are you?

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.320
Take a guess.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.079
You're...?

00:37:58.239 --> 00:37:59.440
You figured it out?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.920
So, do you know

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.719
what I want?

00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:06.639
What do you want?

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:09.159
I don't even know you.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.960
I know about

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.840
Zhang Xiaohong.

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:12.880
Compared to me,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.800
she has a better chance

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.639
of recovering.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.480
Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.440
can do the surgery.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.719
But it's costly

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.119
and can't be delayed.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.559
Half a million. This is half.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.000
Another half a million after we're done.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.000
A million.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.960
What do you want?

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:37.559
How did Lin Fang die?

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.599
From heart disease.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.679
Her heart failed.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.920
Did you see it?

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.519
Tell the truth

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.079
and take the money.

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:51.480
Otherwise,

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.400
I'm leaving now.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.960
You saw Lin Fang die

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:02.920
from her illness?

00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:13.800
I handled the funeral.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.880
Answer my question.

00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:19.039
Scared of being charged
with harboring criminals?

00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:22.760
I've consulted a lawyer.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.079
Relax. Three years maximum.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.920
Zhang Xiaohong will still be there.

00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:28.480
And after what you've done,

00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:30.320
she'll wait for you.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.559
You saw it yourself?

00:39:40.679 --> 00:39:41.760
Zeng Jie told me that.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.320
I didn't get to see my sister.

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:47.400
Zeng Jie killed her?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.079
She might have died from her illness,

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:51.159
but...

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.079
I don't know.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.239
How much money

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.239
have you extorted from Zeng Jie?

00:39:57.519 --> 00:39:58.880
Probably around

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:00.559
300,000 yuan.

00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:01.760
He kept giving you money

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.719
out of affection for Lin Fang

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:05.199
or to silence you?

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:06.960
Ridiculous.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.880
He's obviously scared of me.

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:10.559
Alright, I'm done.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.920
Take the money.

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:45.159
What kind of soil

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:47.159
are we even looking for?

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:49.280
The soil around here

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.119
looks the same to me.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.400
No rush.

00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:54.159
Search slowly.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.639
The soup is ready.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.079
Come on.

00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:25.840
We should

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.480
probably head back soon.

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.639
Returning the car after 6 PM

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.400
incurs

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.039
an extra half-day fee.

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:35.039
No rush.

00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:36.440
Keep looking.

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:39.440
Shall we try another spot?

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.159
I think the soil here

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.480
is all similar.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.280
Zeng Jie.

00:42:06.199 --> 00:42:06.760
Medicine.

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:09.440
In my bag.

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:15.199
Okay, I'll look for it.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.360
Stay calm.

00:42:20.039 --> 00:42:21.039
Hurry up.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.480
Easy, I'll find it soon.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.960
My heart hurts.

00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:52.880
Give me the medicine.

00:42:55.199 --> 00:42:56.679
Give me the medicine now.

00:42:58.239 --> 00:42:59.880
I feel awful.

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:06.719
Medicine...

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:12.679
Be good.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.639
It'll be over soon.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.719
It'll be over soon.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.000
I received a gift.

00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:25.920
It's special.

00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:28.039
Just

00:45:28.039 --> 00:45:29.320

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:43.872
Thank you.

00:45:47.552 --> 00:45:47.957
Okay.

00:45:47.957 --> 00:45:48.608

00:45:50.144 --> 00:45:51.776

00:45:51.776 --> 00:45:52.736
Stay away from me.

00:45:55.456 --> 00:45:56.036
Come on.

00:45:57.337 --> 00:45:59.136
Wei, this is great.

00:45:59.648 --> 00:46:01.184
I thought you were dead.

00:46:01.184 --> 00:46:02.208
Are you crazy?

00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:03.840
Sorry, let's retake. I messed up.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.800
Get off. Hurry.

00:46:15.584 --> 00:46:16.320
Again.

00:46:20.064 --> 00:46:21.312
