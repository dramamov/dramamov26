00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.680
Who is this guy?

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.280
He's a video blogger.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.519
Check his channel.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.599
I want to know

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:59.760
what he has done,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.359
and whom he frequently meet.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.840
That's too vague.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.640
Fine.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:05.439
Let me check

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.359
this guy's basic info.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.599
Anything else?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.560
And this.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.080
Isn't this your wife?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.672
I want to know
who she's been meeting lately,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.800
or if she's getting close

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.400
to anyone.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.840
Got it.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.319
Collect evidence of infidelity.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.599
As always,

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.199
authorization.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.360
Zeng Jie contacted your agency?

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.919
He probably got our contact

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.520
from someone.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.120
He came to see me wearing glasses

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.639
and a mask.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.319
Little did he know

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.960
I recognized him immediately.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.759
Last year,

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.360
you commissioned me, right?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.199
So

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.199
I'm giving you a heads-up.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.960
Bai Xiaoling is disabled now.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.719
Cheating would be too difficult.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.400
Besides,

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.120
she's not the type to cheat.

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.479
Listen.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.400
Take this case first.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.240
If you find anything,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.879
don't tell Zeng Jie.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.080
Tell me first.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.319
By the way,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.080
regarding that Yang Zhenghui

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.560
he wants investigated,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.759
update me

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.319
on any findings too.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.439
Absolutely.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.560
I was so foolish back then.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.120
Why did I have to threaten

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.919
to jump off?

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.479
I made myself disabled.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:37.639
Do you think that fool

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.719
is thrilled about it?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.680
Because finally,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.479
he could dump

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.120
his burden.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.080
I should just

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.159
live gloriously,

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.080
dress impeccably every day,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.400
and appear before him

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.280
from time to time.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.000
The past can't be changed.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.680
Women care about love.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.400
I understand.

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.240
You have no idea.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.840
I'm talking about Lin Fang.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.280
Look.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.560
Lin Fang

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.159
seems meek and mild,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.840
but stubborn beneath the surface.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.599
She was with Zeng Jie,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.280
(Wine)
and they even held a wedding banquet.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.639
How could Lin Fang

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.879
easily accept

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.280
being dumped by Zeng Jie?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.720
A person like her,

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.959
once she sets her heart

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.879
on someone,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.439
she'd cling

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.360
to them even in death.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:22.480
Zeng Jie

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.319
struggled

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.879
from a village to reach the city,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.519
nearly achieving elite status.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.399
Why would he

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.800
let Lin Fang hold him back?

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.600
Unable to shake Lin Fang off,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.360
Zeng Jie had

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.519
a motive to kill her.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.319
That would be Lin Fang's own doing.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.968
Men dread the wrong career,
for women, the wrong man.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.720
If a woman loses her judgment,

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:42.759
she might really

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.600
lose her life.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.839
Does Zeng Jie

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.879
seem like a killer?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.240
I've never met him.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.079
Only after you mentioned him

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.279
did I find something.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.360
When Lin Shan brought me food,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.360
I chatted casually and got him to talk.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.800
His reactions felt off to me.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.040
Zeng Jie

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.879
is now thriving.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.040
It seems he's become
some kind of master now.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360
Back in the day,

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.360
whenever he saw me,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.079
he'd dutifully call me "Boss".

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.480
But now,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.959
he wouldn't even recognize me.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.800
How did your sister
end up with him back then?

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.319
My sister...

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.959
Who knows

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.279
how they got together.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.079
But to be honest,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.839
my sister had good taste.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.720
Back then, she said Zeng Jie

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.839
was bound to succeed.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.000
But my sister

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.399
wasn't destined for that fortune.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.079
She barely enjoyed anything.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:42.879
How did she suddenly

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.040
pass away later?

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.000
Fate's cruelty.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.040
Forget him.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.800
Mentioning him makes me angry.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.680
He's your sister's husband.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.879
Why are you so angry?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.639
H-How could I not be angry?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.360
My sister followed him since she was 18.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.240
Now he's

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.680
thriving and successful.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.519
And my sister?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.240
She's gone for long.

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.600
Can I not be angry?

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:13.240
He said he was angry.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
But when I looked at him,

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.279
it didn't seem genuine.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.800
Could it be that

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:19.720
Lin Fang and Lin Shan

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.120
had a strained relationship?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.720
Their parents died early.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.759
No matter what,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800
they were siblings

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:26.759
who grew up together.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.040
Then why would Lin Shan's reactions

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000
be off?

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:33.560
This is just a hypothesis.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.680
If

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.879
Lin Fang's death

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.439
was connected to Zeng Jie,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.759
Lin Shan would likely

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.839
know about it.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.279
So how could he

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.480
possibly just

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:44.680
let it go?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.279
Yes.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:47.879
Lin Shan arranged

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920
Lin Fang's funeral,

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.240
the death certificate

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.519
and also the deregistration.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:52.759
Do you think

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.120
Lin Shan helped Zeng Jie cover up?

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.160
After my accident,

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.079
Lin Shan genuinely treated me well.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.639
But I

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.399
know him well.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.120
He's always been idle,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.920
without even a job.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.600
My hospital stay these years
cost at least several hundred thousand.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.560
Where do you think

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.720
he got the money?

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:13.920
The only person

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.879
with money he knows

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.000
is Zeng Jie.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.879
By your logic,

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.759
Lin Fang's death links to Zeng Jie,

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.120
and Lin Shan knew the truth.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.759
These years,

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.519
Zeng Jie's been paying Lin Shan

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.079
for helping him

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.800
hide the secret.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.360
It was a deal

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.079
between them.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.759
If you find a way

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.279
to see

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.160
the money transfers,

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.208
you may find something.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:35.120
Unlikely.

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.120
Zeng Jie is very cautious.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.439
He wouldn't transfer

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.199
and leave traces.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.560
He'd probably use cash.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.879
Cash?

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:44.639
Yes. I just remembered.

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.160
He paid cash when the hospital

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.240
asked for payment.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.560
If that's the case,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.959
the logic checks out completely.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.079
But how do we find evidence?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.519
Lin Fang passed away

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.360
so many years ago.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.160
And we don't know

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240
how Zeng Jie did it.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.319
Isn't that easy?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.279
Lin Fang

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:00.800
was born

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.639
with a heart disease.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.439
She always carried medication.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.560
So if

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.279
Zeng Jie

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.680
deliberately induced her illness,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.000
and didn't save her

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.680
or give her meds,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.319
wouldn't she

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.160
have died from it?

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.160
But death might be better.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.319
Better than lying here in bed like me,

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.639
just waiting to die.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.480
You need to have faith in yourself.

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:27.000
Big Hui,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.079
can you teach me to make videos?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.759
I really love deduction.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.480
I'll keep trying

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.879
to get clues from Lin Shan.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.679
Trust me.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.600
I can do this.

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:37.159
I trusted you too much.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.120
What you did today

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.600
is really impressive.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.240
But

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.720
I-I have a question.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.279
Lin Shan has been so good to you.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.559
If the truth turns out
as you speculated,

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.159
then Lin Shan would be a criminal.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.399
How could you bear

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:54.080
to do this to him?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.559
If the truth

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.639
really ends up this way,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.840
Lin Shan would keep asking for money

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.799
from Zeng Jie.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:04.440
A few tens of thousands yearly might be

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:05.519
manageable.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:07.840
I'm afraid he really

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.240
wants to cure me.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.080
Lin Shan asked around.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.759
Send me to Beijing or Shanghai,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.000
and I may actually be cured.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.639
But the surgery costs over a million.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.600
That's a lot of money.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.679
What if he pushes Zeng Jie too hard?

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.559
Zeng Jie

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.320
killed Lin Fang.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:27.960
Why not

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:28.879
kill Lin Shan too?

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.159
But back then, I didn't know

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.000
or think

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:32.759
about his sister.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.600
Since you

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.320
mentioned it,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.120
I've been worried.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.039
I'd rather stay

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:37.799
disabled forever,

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:40.039
or have Lin Shan in prison for years,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.039
than have him

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.840
die

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.720
without reason.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:45.720
Tracy,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.000
your mind

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.679
is sharper than I imagined.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.200
But in the end,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.639
they two have suffered enough.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.039
One for an unfaithful man,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.000
and the other for a disabled woman.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.919
What a miserable life.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.960
Right.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:08.240
I've got one more question.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.000
What is it?

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.799
It makes sense logically.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.360
But...

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.200
Lack evidence.

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:19.120
I know there's no evidence.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.720
So I'm just chatting with you.

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:21.639
So

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.279
following your logic,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.799
Zeng Jie could kill Lin Fang.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.720
He could also kill Liu Wei.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:29.519
We discussed before

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.639
about the kind

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.840
of girls Zeng Jie goes after.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.440
Poor family backgrounds.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.000
Most are from other cities.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.600
And Lin Fang's situation.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.399
I think from the very beginning,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.440
he'd had a backup plan.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.720
Not necessarily kill.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.399
But if someone

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.799
got in his way,

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:46.919
taking actions

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.840
would be much easier.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.360
Don't you think this guy

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:53.039
is way too obsessed with women?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.519
It's not just lust driving him.

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.559
He seems to use this pattern

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.360
to fuel his ego

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.679
or compensate for some inadequacy.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.919
Does Zeng Jie

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.519
have unresolved trauma in his past

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:09.440
that we didn't find?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.039
You're

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.480
all over the place.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.600
Tell me.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.759
What else did you find?

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.600
Nothing concrete yet.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.320
Zeng Jie burned

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.120
all possible

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.919
evidence.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:24.639
So

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:25.759
based on your theory,

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.440
if Liu Wei was murdered,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.480
Zeng Jie Studio

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.559
is the primary crime scene.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.960
If it isn't,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.080
why would he burn it?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.799
Makes sense.

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:38.720
A massive fire

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:40.440
destroyed the weapons and scene

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:41.200
all at once.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:45.960
I regret it so much.

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:47.600
When Wei broke up with me,

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.080
I should've tried to stop her.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.759
At least that might've saved her.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.039
It's not your fault.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.039
To be honest,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.000
I really respect you.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.840
You're still digging into her case

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.399
after all this time.

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:00.720
What a man.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.600
Zhang Xiaohong

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.440
really surprised me.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.279
When asked if she cared about Lin Shan,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.519
her answer was really

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.799
generous.

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.000
What did you ask her finally?

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.240
I told her all about Bai Xiaoling

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.320
and what she had

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.320
with Zeng Jie.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.360
I wanted to know

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.840
how someone like her,

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:21.000
with similar experiences

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.440
and physical disabilities,

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.200
would deal

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.200
with Zeng Jie.

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:26.320
You trust her so much?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.720
Just wanted to hear what she thought.

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:31.360
What did she say?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.600
She said she's not sure.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:33.480
She'll tell me

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.200
when she is.

don't force yourself to endure.

00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:12.120
Get divorced early

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.000
and start fresh.

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.279
I can't accept this.

What can't you accept?

Life

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:20.240
is full of setbacks.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:22.320
I chose him back then.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.919
I ignored your advice

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.080
and married him.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.039
This mess is mine,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.200
and I'll clean it up myself.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.519
How exactly?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.080
After all that trouble,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.879
what do you really get out of it?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.080
He married you

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:34.720
and took everything he wanted.

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:35.960
You've lost everything

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200
that's not yours.

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:39.039
I'll make him pay back

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.720
all your money.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.759
Xiaoling,

00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:42.720
stop sinking deeper into this.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.519
You ignored my warnings

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:45.440
when marrying him.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.679
Now, you do the same

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.000
about the divorce.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.279
I have my own plan.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.639
What's your plan?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.480
Tell me.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.240
I won't let anyone

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.759
take advantage of our family

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.559
and treat us like fools.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.919
Thank you.

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:26.600
Next.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.039
Okay.

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:28.440
Thank you.

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:36.120
(Kelly)

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:37.799
(visited)

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:38.960
(Detective Hale's office)

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:40.440
(and hired him)

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.519
(to look into her husband)

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.840
(Jackson's affair.)

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:44.960
(Soon,)

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:46.000
(Hale captured...)

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.159
An afternoon meeting was canceled.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.639
I didn't receive your message.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.200
I assumed you'd be at home.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.799
I didn't cook for you.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.759
It's fine.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.799
I ate earlier.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:58.559
Not hungry now.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.399
Didn't go to the café today?

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.519
Visited my dad this afternoon.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:24.639
Right.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:26.320
I was about to tell you.

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:27.960
I finally freed up

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:29.000
some money.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:31.159
Your parents will get it soon.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:33.840
How soon?

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:35.080
Half a month.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:35.840
How much?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.360
About one to two million.

00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:39.559
A drop in the bucket.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.200
Better than nothing.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.639
There's nothing to worry about.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.584
- In the long run, the company...
- Okay.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.200
At least it'll make them feel better.

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:51.039
I don't expect much anyway.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.000
Xiaoling,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.320
I know you have a lot

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:59.200
against me.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.399
I don't want to explain too much.

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:03.120
Anyway, two years later,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.039
you'll know it.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.920
I know it.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.200
You're stalling for two years.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.160
Can we just

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.960
talk properly?

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.599
Agreeing to two years

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.799
just means talking properly?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.519
Since you used the wheelchair,

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.599
your mood's been worse
than it was before.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.000
Honestly, I can understand.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.119
How can you?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.799
You're perfectly healthy.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:33.960
At best, you just

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.000
understand in words.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.319
Along with my worsening mood

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.559
comes the deterioration

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.920
of my physical condition.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.720
Every swallow is torture for me.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.160
As I don't want

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.599
my legs to completely atrophy.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.720
I don't want my body

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.559
to be ruined.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.359
Maybe

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.039
I can accompany you for a walk?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.079
I take walks daily.

00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:05.599
No.

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:07.640
I don't have legs.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.279
I walk in a wheelchair.

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.720
You know how much I loved traveling.

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:16.759
Now it's become an impossible dream.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720
You want to travel now?

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.720
When we first married,

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.240
you said you'd find time

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:32.400
to take me to the mountains,

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:34.359
watch how you find

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.279
and dig clay.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:36.400
And now?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.200
Still want that?

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:40.039
Zeng Jie.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.599
Do you think I can still

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:44.920
climb a mountain now?

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.519
I can push you.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.079
We don't need to go off-road,

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.680
just somewhere you can manage.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
Maybe then,

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:56.400
your mood would improve.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.359
Do you even have time?

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.920
I'll adjust classes next week.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.000
I can take a few days off.

00:19:05.799 --> 00:19:06.440
No big deal.

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:07.960
Xiaoling,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.440
I know deep down

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:10.680
there's

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:12.880
something really wrong
with our marriage.

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:13.839
But...

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:17.359
But after all,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.960
we did love each other once.

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.079
I hope through my efforts,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.440
I can mend

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.519
our relationship.

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.039
I understand.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:32.759
During these years of marriage,

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.759
I've always been busy.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.680
I really haven't

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:39.440
properly traveled with you.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.480
It was your best friend

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.640
who went out with you

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.319
and had fun those years.

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:48.160
I never managed to be by your side.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:51.960
Okay.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.640
You plan the trip.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.160
Dad.

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:14.240
How was yesterday?

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.279
How was Zeng Jie?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.720
Actually, I should be asking you.

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:19.720
Do you want him to do well,

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.400
or poorly?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.200
If you think he did well,

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:24.440
everyone's happy.

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:26.079
If you think he didn't,

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:27.160
then we

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:28.119
will have a rift.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.079
Come on.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.119
Before you're married,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.720
you're already taking his side.

00:20:34.839 --> 00:20:35.400
It seems

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.559
you really like Zeng Jie.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:41.079
I deliberately

00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:43.119
invited him to a Michelin restaurant.

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:44.240
Throughout the meal,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.359
from ordering to tasting,

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:47.799
he showed

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.359
no signs of nervousness.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.720
He even quietly

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.759
paid the bill midway.

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:52.960
This meal probably

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.240
cost him over a month's salary.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.200
Yet I noticed he didn't

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.079
hesitate at all.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.480
That shows he takes you seriously.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:03.039
He checked out the restaurant

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:04.160
in advance,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.920
just to give you

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.799
a good impression.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.680
Of course, I know that.

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.160
But don't forget,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.319
he's just an ordinary teacher.

00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:13.839
He doesn't care about money.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.799
He's an artist.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.480
If he were truly an artist,

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.119
he wouldn't have rushed to pay the bill.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.359
I think he was trying

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.119
to please me

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.160
while pretending to be
neither subservient

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:26.200
nor arrogant.

00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:27.720
What's wrong with that?

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:29.279
Nothing at all.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.319
It's good.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.279
Very considerate.

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:33.599
But before he entered the subway,

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.359
I noticed something he did.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.400
Please,

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:41.640
give me some money.

00:21:45.079 --> 00:21:45.720
Of course,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400
I'm not someone

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.160
showing sympathy

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.799
on every beggar I see.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.680
But at the very least,

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.839
I won't turn a blind eye.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.599
Empathy

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.920
is an innate human instinct.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.200
But Zeng Jie's actions

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.079
show

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.319
he has

00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:02.119
low empathy

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.920
and tends to be indifferent.

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:05.359
I know you don't like

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.240
what I'm saying,

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:08.319
but I think Zeng Jie

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.119
is inherently

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.400
not kind.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.359
I might believe you

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:13.160
in anything else.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.200
But on this one,

00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:15.200
you must be wrong.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.319
I met Zeng Jie

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:18.759
because of his kindness.

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:19.799
Yes,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.000
you've told me that.

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:22.880
But have you considered

00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:25.000
what if instead of two beauties

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:26.359
and a luxury car,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.519
there were two old men

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:28.759
and a piece-of-junk car?

00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:31.480
Dad, you're being a bit argumentative.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.920
I'm good-looking.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.640
That's the truth.

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:36.559
You can't use that truth

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:37.920
to label everyone liking me

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.200
as some lust-driven creep.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.359
I'm not trying to argue with you.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.960
I just need to see clearly

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.559
what kind of person this Zeng Jie

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.759
you fancy really is.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.559
Even if he's putting on an act,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.799
I'll accept it.

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:54.519
Men like him

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.799
are double-edged swords.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.440
If he's

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.680
genuinely devoted to you,

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.039
that's wonderful.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:03.119
But if he has ulterior motives,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.200
then

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:06.200
what you'll risk losing

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:07.599
is your entire life.

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:08.839
He won't.

00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:37.799
Zhang Ye?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:38.920
Surprised?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.880
How did you know I am here?

00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:42.759
Let me give you

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:43.799
a bigger surprise first.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.440
You investigated me?

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.640
Do I look that bored to investigate you?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.720
Someone else was investigating you.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.680
I happened to have hired him before.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.960
When he sent documents,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.240
I spotted your photo.

00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.319
So I came to tell you.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.720
Who's investigating me?

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:03.400
Care to guess?

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.039
Zeng Jie?

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:10.279
I took the liberty

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.319
to show these to your husband,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.359
proving you haven't met anyone

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.440
except yourself.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.000
Thank you.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.559
I should thank you

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:26.519
for not blaming my action.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.039
About last year's incident,

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:30.519
I should thank you too.

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:33.559
Let's drop the formal thanks.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.559
I just

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.039
don't understand

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.119
why your husband investigates you.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.720
And

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.200
who's this guy?

00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:46.640
He's a friend of mine.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.640
What friend?

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:53.720
I know he's your friend.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.200
Obviously,

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.640
he can't be your lover.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.400
You're not the type to cheat.

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:04.559
Thanks for trusting me.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.559
Of course, I trust you.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.799
The problem is your husband doesn't.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.079
He ordered investigations on two people.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.359
You,

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:14.759
and him,

00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:16.480
Yang Zhenghui.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.759
He hired a lawyer
to investigate Yang Zhenghui?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.400
So

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.000
I came specifically to inform you.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.559
You've been here every day lately?

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:37.119
The coffee's mediocre though.

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.079
You like the environment here?

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:42.079
I love the sunlight here.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.119
Xiaoling,

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:47.160
let me add one more thing.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.839
Now that your husband

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:51.200
is investigating you,

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:53.319
why aren't you divorcing him?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.039
Get divorced, okay?

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.519
Let me help you, okay?

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.759
How long will you

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:12.680
keep struggling?

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.680
Thank you, Zhang Ye.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.599
But I want to give

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.480
myself some time.

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:19.599
(Talking with a classmate.
Meet at the café tomorrow.)

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:20.400
Still delaying?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.799
I'm not delaying.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.559
I just want to be certain.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.319
Fine.

00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:28.680
Be certain.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.000
When you've been certain,

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:31.880
come find me.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.119
You deleted me before.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.920
Add me again, okay?

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:41.200
I'll scan you.

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:50.240
Well, your wife

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.519
appears completely alone

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:52.720
with no signs of cheating.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.680
When you showed up,

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.799
I got a bit excited,

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:02.799
thought it was a scoop,

00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:03.839
but it was you.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.680
But don't worry.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.119
My assistant will follow up.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.079
If there's any news,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160
we'll tell you promptly.

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:10.200
The other person?

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:11.119
Yang Zhenghui,

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:11.839
30 years old,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.384
from Hunan.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.039
He attended university in Caorong,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.240
majoring in marketing.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.960
After graduation,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.240
he worked as an estate agent.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680
Less than a year later,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.079
he went to an advertising company.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.880
He resigned after eighteen months.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.400
Then he went

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.359
to Tibet with friends

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.079
to film a documentary,

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:26.119
but it flopped.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:27.440
He also ran a blog

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:28.359
and had side jobs.

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:29.319
Three years ago,

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:30.559
he started a channel,

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:31.400
making videos

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.720
specifically on

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.200
case analysis,

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.319
called

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:36.920
The Logic Behind...

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
The Logic Behind Truth.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.759
Exactly!

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.920
Over 100k followers.

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:41.160
When videos were popular,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.240
he could earn some money.

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:42.839
However,

00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:43.920
he also did some

00:27:44.319 --> 00:27:45.359
driving gigs for money.

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:46.640
He hasn't updated

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.839
his short videos for a while.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:50.200
What you've mentioned

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:51.680
are all basic information.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.680
But if you want to investigate

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.079
what he wants to do

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.200
or what he is doing,

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:57.440
it's not that simple.

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.200
But rest assured.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.240
I'll tell you

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.240
once there's progress.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:02.920
Good work.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.320
Professor Zeng,

00:28:04.384 --> 00:28:06.200
why do you always wear
a mask and sunglasses?

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:07.119
Aren't you stuffy?

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.279
Investigate!

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.079
Okay.

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:12.240
I'm leaving.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:25.519
What's it?

00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:28.279
It's been over two days.

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.319
That Big Hui

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.799
still hasn't come to find me.

00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:32.119
What then?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.640
You want him to look for you?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.839
No,

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:38.240
I want to figure out

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:40.759
who's actually targeting you
behind the scenes.

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:44.839
If he wants to find you,

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:45.599
he'll show up.

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:46.720
When he called me

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:48.039
that time,

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.240
he sounded urgent.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.279
I don't know what he wanted.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.960
Then you definitely shouldn't rush.

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:54.559
It's fine.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.119
If he truly comes,

00:28:56.119 --> 00:28:57.079
just tell the truth.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.720
If he doesn't show up,

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:00.119
you can ignore it.

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:01.279
So be it.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.200
Oh, Big Hui,

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.799
why don't you come find me?

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.839
Polishing is one
of the most charming parts

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.400
in ceramic making.

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:29.799
Layer by layer,

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:31.440
all the bumps,

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:32.799
uneven flaws

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.200
and wrinkles

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:35.839
are smoothed out

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.119
in this process,

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.759
making it closer and closer
to perfection.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.440
Do you think it's boring?

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.559
I often

00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:47.880
exfoliate and remove dead skin too.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.200
If polishing life

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.640
could be simple as exfoliating,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680
that'd be great.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.519
Right.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720
Master Zeng

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.480
can't even tolerate blemish flaws,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.279
how could you not meticulously

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:03.720
polish your own life?

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.240
If you keep polishing like this,

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:09.079
will you polish me away too?

00:30:11.079 --> 00:30:12.279
What nonsense are you talking?

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.839
You know exactly

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.920
how I care about you.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.319
You care about me

00:30:20.839 --> 00:30:22.200
because I don't care about you.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:23.920
I don't want to marry you

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:25.799
or spend eternity with you.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.599
That's how people are.

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:30.119
They don't learn
until they pay the price.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.480
Just like my dad and mom.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:35.920
Even after years of divorce,

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.240
they still only care about themselves.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.640
How do you get along?

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:41.920
Get along?

00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:53.200
I know she's acting.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.279
She knows I know she's acting.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.440
She knows I'm acting.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.960
I know she knows I'm acting.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.079
So we both just

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400
keep up our own acts,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.599
fully aware of each other's performance.

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:06.640
I often wonder

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.279
if our marriage

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.279
is an exception

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.480
or just like most others.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.000
I don't know

00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:18.920
what marriage is like.

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:20.640
And I don't want to know.

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:23.119
But your marriage

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.400
is already at stake.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.000
Have you thought of leaving?

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:31.119
This marriage hasn't brought me

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:32.079
much happiness,

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.839
but it's not painful.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.400
It's not

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.160
the best time to end it now.

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:38.559
Besides,

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:40.200
it hasn't become

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.960
an obstacle yet.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.839
Otherwise,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.759
I wouldn't ignore it.

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:53.039
Master Zeng,

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:54.759
you keep polishing.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.359
I'll hang out with friends,

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.440
not being with you today.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:57.920
Bye-bye.

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.640
Stop drinking.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.279
The doctor said you can't drink.

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:43.200
Where did all the money

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:44.359
come from?

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.960
I worked at a gallery.

00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:47.440
150 per piece.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.759
I made 2,000 of them.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.920
When you were ten,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.119
I went to the city with villagers

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.319
to look for jobs.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.200
A townsman's uncle

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:02.279
was the foreman.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.640
He took us to do renovation jobs.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.640
I did that job for over a decade.

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:08.880
Otherwise,

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:11.319
I couldn't afford your education.

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:13.640
Sit.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.079
Back then,

00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:22.960
when renovating homes,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.720
the foreman taught us

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:27.880
how to judge if a boss is decent.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.359
If they come to the site,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.799
bringing us drinks or snacks,

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:34.640
and greet us first,

00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:37.480
saying "Good work",

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.200
they're good people.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.839
Those who come empty-handed

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:46.279
and boss us around

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.200
while constantly complaining

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:50.000
about everything

00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:52.720
are bad people.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.160
With good people,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.279
work would be easier.

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.359
Just do the basics right.

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:03.400
If they want changes,

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:05.160
we can drag it out

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:06.920
to earn extra days' pay.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.719
With bad people,

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.960
you must work meticulously.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.679
Do it poorly,

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.159
and they'll replace

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.440
the whole crew.

00:34:17.039 --> 00:34:18.960
They'll argue over your pay and never

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:19.800
give it to you.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.320
After all these years,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.320
I've learned just one thing.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.960
Nice guys finish last.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.559
Son,

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.119
those old sayings hold truth.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:39.679
I carried buckets

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.079
up and down ladders,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.920
painting walls for over a decade.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.440
And I kept wondering

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.199
why city folks

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.880
get to live in such big houses,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.559
while we only paint walls for others.

00:34:57.159 --> 00:34:58.400
It never made sense to me.

00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:00.719
Never.

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:02.880
The foreman said

00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:04.760
people should accept fate.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.760
I accepted it.

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:10.519
This is what my life will always be.

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:13.440
Son,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.119
you're different.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.760
You've made it

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.639
to university,

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:27.440
and are about to start graduate school.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.039
You'll settle in the city

00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:32.000
and change your fate.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.119
If you succeed,

00:35:33.519 --> 00:35:34.360
my years

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.519
of painting walls

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.800
would be worth it.

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:50.400
Lin Fang

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.320
is a good wife.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.920
I'm very satisfied with her.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.079
She is thrifty,

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.480
respectful to elders,

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.039
and never complains.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.599
She is such a good wife.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.800
What a pity.

00:36:08.719 --> 00:36:10.880
Feelings can't be forced.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.079
Son,

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:17.000
remember.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.679
Since ancient times,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.599
marriage

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.480
has always been a lifelong commitment.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.440
Don't hold her back.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.760
You're educated

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:32.199
and know more than I do.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:33.960
But

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.599
there's one thing

00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:37.880
I need to tell you.

00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:40.760
Whatever you do,

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.199
don't hesitate.

00:36:43.679 --> 00:36:44.559
Just do it.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.360
Don't overthink

00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:47.960
about anything else.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.119
You just move forward with all efforts.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.920
If anyone blocks you,

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400
compete with them.

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:56.000
We scare nothing.

00:36:58.199 --> 00:36:59.840
I get it, Dad.

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:02.639
So do you know

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.039
who's blocking you now?

00:37:06.639 --> 00:37:07.320
Who?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.800
Me.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.719
Look.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.199
You want to treat me

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.320
and get more money.

00:37:20.039 --> 00:37:21.840
It's all holding you back.

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:24.719
You're my dad.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.239
So what if I am?

00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:27.679
Not even your dad.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.239
Listen carefully.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.239
Stop treating me.

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:34.599
What's the point of being cured?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.719
I'd still be a cripple.

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:38.280
Except for spending money,

00:37:38.519 --> 00:37:39.360
what else can I do?

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.639
I'm a burden to you.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.400
If you're truly filial,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.000
find me a peaceful way

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.039
and let me die.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.599
Otherwise,

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:51.760
I'll drink paraquat.

00:37:52.039 --> 00:37:53.320
Dad, listen to me.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.079
Did you

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.039
hear what I said?

00:37:59.199 --> 00:38:00.800
Don't give the money to your mom,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.440
or use it to build a house back home.

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:06.239
Every penny should be spent

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.480
where it truly matters.

00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:10.000
Consider these things carefully.

00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:13.280
Be grateful

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:14.480
to your teachers

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:17.360
and superiors.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.400
Thank them

00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:22.039
for enabling your graduate studies.

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:25.039
Repay them when you can.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.760
In the future,

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:28.360
stay at school as a teacher.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.599
Staying as a teacher

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:33.480
isn't that easy.

00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:34.400
Of course, it's not.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.599
Changing fate

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.000
isn't that easy.

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:39.559
Once you become a teacher,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.000
it's not just a job.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.599
Your status and position will change.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.480
It's hard.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.960
Keep going, no matter how hard it is.

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:48.679
Alright.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.400
Dad,

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.639
I'll do as you say.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.559
But treat

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.480
the illness first.

00:38:53.639 --> 00:38:54.039
I can

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:55.239
figure the money out.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.199
Are you deaf or something?

00:38:59.079 --> 00:39:00.599
What's on your mind?

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:02.159
Overthink everything.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.079
How can you achieve anything this way?

I admit I approached Bai Xiaoling

with ulterior motives.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.719

about Zeng Jie from her.

I find she's genuinely kind.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.440
Do you like her

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:13.360
or is it pity?

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:14.679
It's not affection,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.079
nor pity either.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.199
Compared to me,

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:17.960
she's so rich

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.920
she can't spend it all.

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:20.559

Well, you were.

00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:28.480
Right, right.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.559

I'll find her tomorrow.

Can't you see Bai Xiaoling

00:42:45.719 --> 00:42:47.480
is in danger around Zeng Jie?

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.360
The fire last year

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.320
erased Wei's traces.

00:42:51.679 --> 00:42:52.719
If Bai Xiaoling had been

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:53.599
on the third floor,

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.920
wouldn't she be gone?

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:56.119
Two birds with one stone.

00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:57.360
And the car crash.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.920
Zeng Jie just serviced his car,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.840
yet brakes failed.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.800
I wish you had evidence.

00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:05.480
You never trust me.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.239
It's not about trust.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.719
I truly hope there's evidence.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.639
You've got

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.400
no evidence

00:43:11.719 --> 00:43:12.800
and no plausible plaintiff

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.239
at all.

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:14.519
If I took the case,

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:15.199
how can I help?

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:16.760
I can't just

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.840
arrest Zeng Jie and say

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:18.840
I suspect you

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.679
killed Liu Wei

00:43:20.159 --> 00:43:20.960
and Lin Fang,

00:43:21.039 --> 00:43:22.039
and will kill your wife,

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:22.639
Bai Xiaoling.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:23.840
Don't ask me why.

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:25.239
I deduced everything.

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:27.880
I'm certain I'll find it.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.119
Wei.

00:44:07.072 --> 00:44:09.792
His primary determination

00:44:09.792 --> 00:44:10.848
is to cross social class.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.512
He aims at social class.

00:44:12.512 --> 00:44:14.582
The entire story
is about class transcendence.

00:44:14.976 --> 00:44:18.528
If they are dissatisfied,
we can still negotiate

00:44:18.528 --> 00:44:20.576
to earn wages for a few more days.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.720
That's already good enough.

00:44:25.472 --> 00:44:26.592
Wait, that's not right.

00:44:28.096 --> 00:44:30.656
Some students say
I'm overly obsessed with polishing.

00:44:31.392 --> 00:44:34.016
Actually, they can't comprehend
the polishing process.

00:44:36.864 --> 00:44:40.576
I regularly exfoliate too.

00:44:43.616 --> 00:44:44.704
Find me when you decide.

00:44:49.888 --> 00:44:51.680
You deleted me before.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.616
How about adding me back?

00:44:56.928 --> 00:44:57.792
I'll walk you out.

00:45:00.192 --> 00:45:02.528
Do you know why
I have to eat these every day?

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.560
Every swallow is torture for me.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.864
Because I don't want my legs
to completely atrophy.

00:45:08.864 --> 00:45:10.560
I don't want my body to...

00:45:11.616 --> 00:45:14.432
