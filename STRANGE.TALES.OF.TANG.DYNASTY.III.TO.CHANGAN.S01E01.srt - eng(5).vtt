To Chang'an]

[Episode 1]

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.640
[In the summer of the second year
of the Xiantian era,]

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640
[Lu Lingfeng, Su Wuming, and their convoy]

[with escorting the golden peaches,
a tribute from the Kang Kingdom,]

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.479
[back to the capital.
They were about to arrive in Chang'an.]

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.590
My dear Sheriff Lu,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.200
let's take a break please.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.360
Even if my old bones

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.200
[Fei the Chicken Oracle]

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.350

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.070
X-Xijun certainly can't take it!

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400
Isn't that right?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.890
[Pei Xijun]

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.150
Transporting the golden peaches
is of utmost importance.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.949
Apologies for the hardship, but we must
push on and pick up the pace.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.190
[Lu Lingfeng]

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.430
We have to reach Chang'an
before nightfall.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.630
Can't we just take a short break?

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.160
Xue Huan,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.720
let's go.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.440
Yes, Master.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.570
[Xue Huan]

[Weicheng Station]

Stationmaster, look!

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.160
Is that them?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.840
Stop!

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.400
[Weicheng Station]

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.730
You there, please wait!

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.520
Are you Sheriff Lu
from Yunding County, Hanzhou Prefecture?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.240
Yes, I am.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.870
There are guests
awaiting you inside the station.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.430
Guests?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.290
Who are they?

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.000
This humble one is not permitted to say.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.560
I am burdened with official duties.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.120
How could I possibly spare the time?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.920
Sheriff Lu, please. Look there.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.910
[Lu Tong,
Grand General of the Right Imperial Guard]

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.980
We'll take care of the carriages.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.000
[Weicheng Station]

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.060
Move all the crates into the station.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.770
Can't you see I'm in plain clothes?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.470
I didn't realize it was you waiting here.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.590
But I'm not the honorable guest
you're here to meet.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.450
Hurry up and come to the backyard.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.020
[Weicheng Station]

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.110
These men may be in plain clothes,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.680
[Chu Yingtao]

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.750
but judging by their bearing,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.880
they're most likely Imperial Guards.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.290
I have matters to attend to
and must take my leave.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.190
[Su Wuming]

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.050
There's no need for you to follow.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.240
Beacon fires devour the capital's night,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.480
and hearts are troubled by deep unrest.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The tiger tally has left the palace;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.150
the iron cavalry closes in
on Dragon Town.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.630
Snow dims the sky,
blotting out the banners;

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.030
the wind is thick
with the thunder of war drums.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.710
Better to lead a hundred men in arms

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.970
than to pore over books
as a mere scholar.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.930
You mean to say,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.910
[The Emperor]

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.590
"Better to lead a hundred men in arms

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.050
than to come before the emperor,"
don't you?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.190
By Your Majesty's decree, I, Lu Lingfeng,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.680
received 18 cases of golden peaches

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.750
from the Kang Kingdom
at Shazhou Prefecture

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.079
and escorted them here.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.920
Due to internal affairs
in the Kang Kingdom,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.870
their diplomatic mission
could not accompany us.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.720
Here is the State Letter.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.190
Rise.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.490
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.630
What is this other document?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.830
[State Letter of the Kang Kingdom]

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.420
It contains my observations
from this journey to the west—

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.120
[A Journey to the West]

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.870
geography, local scenes and products,
folk traditions,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.190
and the living conditions
of the common populace.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.000
I've also recorded
some governmental malpractices

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.920
and proposed measures
to improve the people's livelihood.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.360
The State Letter can wait.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.120
Though they presented golden peaches,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.720
failing to send a single envoy

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.580
is in itself a breach of protocol.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.030
But this work, into which

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.540
you've poured your heart and effort,
warrants my close attention.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.830
[A Journey to the West]

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.510
This memorial was jointly submitted

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.159
by Su Wuming and myself.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.159
Su Wuming?

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.210
He holds no official rank.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.750
Since when has he had the authority
to submit memorials directly?

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.480
During our journey to the west,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.740
Su Wuming also risked his life

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.430
-for the Tang Empire.
-I'm aware of that.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.310
I have already read

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.510
Lu Si'an's memorial.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.980
Though Su Wuming holds no office,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.680
as a resident of the Tang Empire,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.240
why should he be denied the right

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.390
to advise the court on matters

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.830
concerning the Tang Empire?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.560
Lu Lingfeng,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.070
watch your mouth!

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.930
Defending him the moment we meet?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.830
That unbending nature of yours

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.000
remains unchanged.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.490
Chancellor Cui,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.890
why hasn't he arrived yet?

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.050
They should have been here by now.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.909
Could Cen Zhi's information

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:41.750
[Grand Princess]

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.870
be wrong again?

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.360
[Chancellor Cui, Chief Secretariat]

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.830
Your Highness, we beg your forbearance.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.159
They must have been delayed along the way.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.630
It's getting late, Your Highness.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.630
It would be advisable for you
to return to the city now.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.910
Su Wuming, come quickly!

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.780
The Princess has been waiting for you
for some time.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.000
This humble commoner, Su Wuming,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.260
pays his respects to the Grand Princess.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.250
It has been nearly a year
since we last met—

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.070
Your Highness grows ever more radiant.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.890
Enough pleasantries.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.630
Where is Lu Lingfeng?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.860
Your Highness,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240
Sheriff Lu has been utterly devoted

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.300
to his duty in escorting the tribute
from the Kang Kingdom.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.560
The journey has been particularly rough,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.190
[Cen Zhi,
Commander of the Princess's Guard]

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.720
and he fears damage to the golden peaches,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.070
hence

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.630
the slower pace.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.270
I'm afraid

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.250
they won't reach Chang'an today,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.430
so he expressly sent me

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040
to bring you word.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.430
My son

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.280
knew I have come out
of the city to welcome him?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.070
H-He must have guessed.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.160
Guessed?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.680
This is what they call a mother-son bond!

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.490
Indeed, indeed.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.480
Su Wuming.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.790
Greetings, Chancellor Cui.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.240
Su Wuming has returned?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.950
And he's still alive?

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.700
Yes.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.520
It was a grave error on my part

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.409
to have let him live to see this day.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.070
As for the future Chancellorship,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.730
my hold on it may not be secure.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.720
It appears

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.870
a rival has emerged.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.330
Bring me the blade.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.780
The golden peaches

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.610
truly live up to their reputation.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.460
Sheriff Lu,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.200
do you intend to remain a mere spectator?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.960
Only you and I are
in attendance upon His Majesty.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.400
With so many golden peaches,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.390
do you mean to burden His Majesty?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.170
So you mean to say

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.730
my son has returned safely

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.360
from this journey to the west

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.760
and gained considerable experience?

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.750
Yes, exactly.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.720
There were moments of alarm,
but no real danger.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.120
Sheriff Lu emerged completely unscathed,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.600
and grew even more broad-minded.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.730
Your Highness,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.970
urgent news!

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.240
How dare you

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.610
deceive me, Su Wuming!

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.920
I would never!

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.510
Every word I just reported was true.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.150
Then why is Lu Lingfeng

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.350
at Weicheng Station?

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.690
Weicheng Station?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.360
Well, after enduring
such a grueling journey

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.550
with little comfort or decent food—

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.240
and everyone knows the famous delicacies

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.440
at Weicheng Station—

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.480
he must have been tempted by the thought
of a good meal.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.340
Still playing word games with me!

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.550
Is that person at Weicheng Station?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.400
Which person?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.510
Who else

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.310
could possibly make Lu Lingfeng
halt his journey?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.320
Hold on.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.550
Your Majesty.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.700
This is precisely what I was looking for.

[Golden Peaches of the Kang Kingdom]

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.990
[Map of the Western Region]

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.150
What is this?

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.560
During the reign of the Empress Wu Zetian,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.480
kingdoms and tribes in the Western Regions

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.540
formed alliances,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.390
blocking the Silk Road from time to time

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.840
and severing trade between east and west.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.030
Yet the Tang Empire,
embroiled in internal strife,

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.870
lacked the resources
for military campaigns.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.000
During my time at the Eastern Palace,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.100
I lamented and strategized
over this matter day and night.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.660
[Elite Cavalry]

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.910
Together with the Grand General,

[Gongyue City]

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.870
we devised a plan:
to dispatch elite agents

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.990
to covertly operate
within the Kang Kingdom,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.200
[Kucha Town]

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.870
where they would gather intelligence
on the various kingdoms

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.910
of the Western Regions,
relay information to Chang'an,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.770
and ultimately

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.720
produce this Map of the Western Regions.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.000
It documents the royal courts
of various states,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.600
crucial for safeguarding our borders
and keeping the Silk Road open.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.200
However, due to constant warfare
in the Western Regions

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.360
and hostility from some factions
toward the Tang Empire,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.320
several attempts

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.320
to deliver the map ended in failure.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.030
Only when we confirmed

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.240
the Kang Kingdom

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.840
would resume paying tribute

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.750
did we formulate the plan

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.480
to conceal it
within the growing golden peaches.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.910
I see. So that's how it is.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.870
So, what you brought back

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.470
transcends golden peaches.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.600
This map

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.630
will greatly assist the Tang Empire's

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.270
future governance
of the Western Regions

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.510
and beyond.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.750
Your Majesty, from the heart of Chang'an,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.440
has laid plans that span the four seas.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.670
Your vision encompasses all under heaven,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.270
and Your foresight is profound.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.200
I am deeply awed,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.390
Your Majesty.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.740
Now,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.230
would you prefer to remain by my side,

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.620
or are you in a rush
to return to Yunding County

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.880
as its county sheriff?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.270
His Majesty defied considerable opposition

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.720
to entrust you with the golden peaches.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.120
Can't you see why you were

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.500
recalled to Chang'an?

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.330
Now that we speak face to face,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.720
certain matters must be addressed.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.740
As for the rumors about your background,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.150
they matter to me,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.760
and yet, they do not.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.980
What about you?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.100
Take your time to decide.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.230
After so long apart,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.010

Attendant Yang,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.960
I thought

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.320
he had been dealt with.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.720

I, Laifu,
will ensure he never reaches Chang'an.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.790
During this journey to the west,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.150
my favorite place

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.720
was Dunhuang in Shazhou Prefecture.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.550
Dunhuang

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.880
is the crossroads of the world,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.780
the vital hub of the Silk Road—

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.960
a bustling metropolis
with breathtaking landscapes.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.480
Your Highness, as a devout Buddhist,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.720
why not spend some time
in Shazhou Prefecture?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.390
I believe

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.720
the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.670
would captivate you endlessly.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.750
Su Wuming,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.420
you are so calculating!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.360
Over the past two years,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.550
many have poisoned
the Retired Emperor's ear

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.610
against me—

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.720
some suggesting

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.270
I be sent to Puzhou Prefecture,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.670
others to Luoyang.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.910
Now

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.670
you advise me to go to Shazhou Prefecture.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.130
Aren't you afraid
I might have you beheaded?

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.330
I

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.720
carry the surname of Li.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.120
I am more fit

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.120
to be this dynasty's empress

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.920
than Empress Wu Zetian ever was.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.630
Do you think

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.030
this is merely my obsession?

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.510
I do this for the empire!

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.240
Su Wuming,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.240
do you recall what I said

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.080
when I bid you farewell here

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.440
years ago?

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.750
If you truly wish what is best
for the Tang Empire,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.980
then aid me in my cause.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.410
I will give the people

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.120
a prosperous golden age.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.320
Today, let there be
no sovereign and subject—

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.520
here are only Sanlang
and his two kindred spirits.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.320
Come,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.300
cheers.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.770
Lu Lingfeng,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.570
since we are kindred spirits,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.760
we should speak without reservation.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.000
Then I must ask—

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.920
have you ever considered taking my life,
Sanlang?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.050
Lu Lingfeng,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.510
what are you saying?

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.210
Continue.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.920
On our journey west,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.420
in Shiyang County,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.550
the assassins I encountered

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.750
were no wanderers of the martial world.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.580
I did dispatch agents—

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.700
to eliminate Su Wuming.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.600
What does that have to do with you?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.150
There were two groups of assassins.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.150
I had anticipated

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.270
that those targeting Su Wuming
were sent by the Grand General.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.240
But the other group

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.500
used poisoned arrows—

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.050
that couldn't possibly be
the Grand General's work.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.710
Later,

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.600
at a place called Mojia Inn,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.550
I nearly fell at the hands

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.720
of bounty hunters.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.720
On their bodies,

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.410
we found documents
ordering my assassination.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.800
This stationery

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.830
isn't what ordinary people use.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.080
The paper

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.690
is exclusively reserved
for the Eastern Palace.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:20.960
Laifu.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.670
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.750
Go wash some golden peaches.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.010
At once, Your Majesty.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.390
Lu Lingfeng's suspicions

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.510
are not unfounded.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.790
I believe

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.330
it must have been Bai Shan—

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.510
he always sought to eliminate

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.840
perceived threats to me
within his lifetime.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.390
You've

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.200
gained my trust,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.210
yet sudden rumors
about your origins emerged,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.870
making you appear as a threat.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.730
Lu Lingfeng,

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.630
I recall you shared

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.720
a good rapport with Bai Shan.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.320
This matter isn't personal.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.480
Bai Shan's loyalty is commendable,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.120
and you,

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.840
born of a family
of renown across the land,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.370
ought to show magnanimity.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.320
If you could toast
to the late Minister Bai now,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.380
I would think even more highly of you.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.510
But he isn't here.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.310
He passed away

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.270
two months ago.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.829
Bai Shan,

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.040
I know your heart was loyal,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.819
but resorting to poisoned arrows

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.200
and hiring bounty hunters

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.660
against Lu Lingfeng was truly unwarranted.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.720
I

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.770
offer you this cup as censure.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.560
After all, this is Chang'an—

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.590
even before entering the city,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.520
we're treated to such delicacies!

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.110
I...

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.310
I-I want to compose a poem!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:19.480
I...

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.910
I... I just can't find the words!

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.110
Mr. Fei,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.550
in the Tang Empire,
poets are everywhere.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.440
Who knows—

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.920
perhaps someday someone
in this Weicheng Station

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.650
will write verses
that endure through the ages.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.210
Exactly!

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.150
Among the 110 wards of Chang'an,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.400
if each ward produced timeless poetry,

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.920
future generations would forever remember

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.440
this magnificent Chang'an.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.200
Miss Xijun, Miss Yingtao,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.000
well said!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Though I, Xue Huan, cannot compose poetry,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.330
your words stir my soul.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.460
Let me toast to you!

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.700
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.310
These golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.370
are the sweetest fruits in the world.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.440
In my youth,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.880
I tasted half of one
at the Princess's Mansion—

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.270
that extraordinary flavor

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.730
remains vivid to this day.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.590
But these are tributes.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.720
I'm simply not entitled...

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.650
As the escort,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.200
you have every right.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.150
Enjoy it, now.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.590
Your Majesty,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.960
if we speak of merit,

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.960
along this trip,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.200
then besides myself

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.880
the five others—
Su Wuming, Pei Xijun, Fei Yingjun,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.070
Chu Yingtao, and Xue Huan—

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.130
all contributed significantly
to the escort mission.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.040
Understood.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.070
These three golden peaches shall be yours

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.270
to share with those
who journeyed west with you.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.400
How does that sound?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.890
In that case,

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.750
thank you, Your Majesty.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.410
Grand General,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.610
let us eat first.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.640
Many thanks, Your Majesty.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.720
Still the same unforgettable taste.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.120
Truly the king of fruits.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:03.480
I am

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.940
fortunate indeed.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.890
Grand General!

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.240
Hurry!

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.710
Fetch the bow and arrows!

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.400
Bring the blade!

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.650
Grand General!

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.670
Grand General, are you alright?

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:48.920
I'm fine.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.860
I'm made of tougher stuff.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.390
It's such a massive

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.640
and ferocious bird, attacking people!

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.370
Lu Lingfeng,

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.410
do you know what species it is?

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.450
I do not know, Your Majesty.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.830
It's back!

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.110
It's back!

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.680
Not the same one—

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.010
this one's even larger.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.720
Protect His Majesty!

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.380
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.550
-Grand General!
-Grand General!

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.350
Never mind me—

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.590
shoot it down!

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880
Something's wrong—

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.080
there's trouble in the rear courtyard!

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.690
Xue Huan, my spear!

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.110
Your Majesty, please retreat inside first.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.070
Everyone else,
guard the doors and windows!

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.230
[Auspicious Clouds and Blazing Sun]

00:23:59.030 --> 00:23:59.590
Master.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.270
-Are you alright?
-Xue Huan.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:52.130
What happened?

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.920
I'm fine.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.240
Lu Lingfeng,

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.350
are you all right?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.070
Liu XVII...

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.090
What did you say?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.110
Wait—

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.720
it could also be Liu XVIII

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.510
or Liu XIX.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.030
The Liu brothers?

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.830
Why are you suddenly

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.490
mentioning Gantang Station?

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.370
Fei Yingjun,

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.090
I hear you're Medicine King's disciple.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.400
If you can save the Grand General's eye,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.720
I'll grant you
any official position you desire.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.780
If you prefer gold,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.800
you shall have it in abundance.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.240
Official rank

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.830
is a thing I desire;

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.070
gold ingots

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.840
are also a thing I desire.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.530
But even with both,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.750
I cannot save that eye.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.970
Don't touch it!

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.060
Grand General,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.440
hold on a little longer.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.400
Laifu.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.000
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.110
When will the imperial physicians arrive?

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.830
They've been summoned urgently
on horseback.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:09.790
It won't help.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.090
Even if my revered teacher
were still alive,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.720
he couldn't save that eye.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.440
Your Majesty,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.280
if you permit me to treat him now,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.400
I can ensure Lu Tong's survival.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.490
But if we delay any longer,

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.480
I'm afraid his life will...

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.210
Lu Lingfeng.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.940
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.740
Should I trust him?

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.280
He truly is a divine physician—

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.440
proven recently in Yunding County,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.100
-as previously in Luoyang—
-I don't need stories. Can I trust him?

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.120
I have absolute faith

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.040
in Fei Yingjun's

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.040
medical skills.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.810
I implore Physician Fei

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.790
to save my Grand General's life at once.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:01.720
You

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960
have my entreaty.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.410
Your Majesty bowing to me?

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.790
This is beyond my station.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.050
I, Fei Yingjun,
will exert my utmost effort, Your Majesty.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.420
Lu Lingfeng,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.900
[Auspicious Clouds and Blazing Sun]

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.250
how is Lu Tong's condition?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.110
His life is not in danger,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.750
but one eye

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.740
is likely lost.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.470
The second raptor was a man in disguise—

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.460
with the face of one of the Liu brothers

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.640
from Gantang Station.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.440
That's right.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.240
This is unbelievable.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.170
By all accounts,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.310
Liu XVII committed grave crimes

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.510
and should have been executed long ago.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.960
Moreover,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.550
neither Liu XVII nor Liu XVIII

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.480
possessed martial skills.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.510
Though Liu XIX was vicious

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.040
with serpent-like traits,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.200
he couldn't possibly
have flown from the sky

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.460
to attack the Emperor.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.400
So I must ask—

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.070
having been absent
from the court for so long,

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.790
were you perhaps so overwhelmed

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.920
that you saw things?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.680
Nonsense!

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.160
In the heat of battle, during crisis—

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.290
could your vision have been impaired?

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.350
You're the one with clouded vision!

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.200
Having drunk several cups,

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.920
your bleary eyes might
have misperceived things.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.480
You...

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.690
Time is critical—

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.380
I have no leisure

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.510
for baseless arguments here.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.910
If you keep pestering me,
don't blame me...

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.750
Since you are so certain about it,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.400
let me go to Gantang County
for investigation.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.310
Fine! I hallucinated, saw incorrectly,

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.110
drank too much, and made a mistake—

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.510
I should go personally
to verify the truth.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.500
How dare I trouble you, Su Wuming?

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.440
How did you know

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.510
I intended to go to Gantang County?

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.680
The Emperor remains at Weicheng Station,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.750
the Grand General is severely wounded—

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.490
if you leave,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.920
what if the raptor returns?

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.000
I've already instructed
the Imperial Guards.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.440
If the Imperial Guards

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.010
could defeat that raptor,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.590
how could Lu Tong

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.880
lose an eye?

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.920
As a mere commoner,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.640
I am useless here—

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.740
I might as well run your errand
to Gantang County.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.730
You stay to protect the Emperor

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.460
and investigate the raptor—

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.250
that's the optimal strategy.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.670
Lingfeng,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.560
the situation is critical.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.000
Guard Weicheng Station tonight—

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.930
admit no one.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.600
Remember,

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.590
no one.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.210
Halt! No further approach!

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.370
I am Li Feng,
the General of Loyalty and Valor.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.550
[Li Feng, General of Loyalty and Valor]

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.240
Hearing of disturbances at the station,
I came to protect His Majesty.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.200
Open the gates.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.260
General Li,

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.000
His Majesty has retired for the night.

None, Your Majesty.

Since Chang'an has no attack record
by such raptors,

What intrigues me is this—

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.920
given your lineage
and military achievements,

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.670

Your Majesty,

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.680

As his superior,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.400

Your Majesty's protection.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.860
This humble servant
is also deeply at fault.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.240
Who could have anticipated

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.680

Your Majesty,

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.880
the second attacker was

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.710
a bird-man?

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.290
One with a human face, indeed.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:57.880
But

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.520
a man disguised as a bird

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.710
flying through the air
is not beyond belief.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:02.310
Back then,

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.800
of anything:

mechanical otters that caught fish,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.320
wooden maidens that served wine,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.400
even one who built a flying machine

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.420

from beyond the Tianjin Bridge.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.020

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.510
the Princess's doing.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.320
Those anomalous talents you mentioned

since pledged allegiance to her.

while avoiding Lu Lingfeng entirely.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.840

of the Princess's involvement?

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.710
We can't yet confirm

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.370
this assistant is the killer.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.970
Creating a portrait

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.010
would only alert our prey.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.380
Understood.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.070
Why did you kill
the owner of the Paper Effigy Shop?

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.420
He tried to kill me first.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.800
It was on your orders, wasn't it?

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.970
And if it was?

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.880
If you kill me now,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.360
who will see your grand design

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.110
through to the end?

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.110
You wanted

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.190
a presentable identity in Chang'an,

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.000
so I pleaded with the shop owner.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.140
He feared you'd implicate him

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.690
and turned against you.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.360
Did you think

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.280
you could do as you please

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.000
and kill freely in Chang'an?

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:45.880
I was wrong.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.940
Only about the killing?

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.110
I shouldn't have doubted you.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.510
If I wanted someone dead,

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.360
I could do it myself effortlessly.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.930
Why would I need a proxy?

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.240
Understood.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.280
Do you remember our agreement?

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.150
Our great undertaking is not yet complete.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.260
We must be united in purpose and effort.
