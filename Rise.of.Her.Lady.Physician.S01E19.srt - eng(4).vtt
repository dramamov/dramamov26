00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.840
Everyone out!

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.200
I only want

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.960
Rong Zelan to stay.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.060
This...

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.400
Mother,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.560
but Rong Zelan

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.880
made a mistake in the treatment.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.840
It has nothing to do with her.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.400
Your Majesty,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.660
perhaps Her Majesty

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.160
has heard some rumors.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.280
Here's my decree.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.720
Find those

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.080
who spread rumors

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.160
within three days

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.840
and execute them all!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.280
Aye!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.280
Never mind.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.400
Let them say it.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.440
They're not wrong.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.040
Your Majesty.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.920
Do you know an ancient female general

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.240
named Fu Hao?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.920
She fought on the frontiers

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
and conducted sacred rites,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240
yet she fell ill due to childbirth.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.000
However, her husband King Wu
and her son Zu Jia

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.320
never despised her

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.920
but cast a vessel for her.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.440
Even now, the oracle bones
bear the words

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.280
"Fu Hao Giving Birth to Jia."

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.520
This is people's respect for her.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.130
Your Majesty, you are the same.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.160
You've had children

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.400
and managed palace affairs.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.040
You've nurtured
such a wise and virtuous emperor.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.640
When people speak of you,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
they will all respect

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.280
and love you.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.800
Son,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.400
I'm just too old,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.880
and I'm sorry

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.960
to have made you worry.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.400
Mother, please don't say that.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
You've done so much

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.640
for me and this nation.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.480
I've seen it with my own eyes

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.600
and kept it in my heart.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.720
I only wish

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.430
I could share your burdens back then.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.160
Mother,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.440
from now on,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.040
I will do whatever it takes
to protect you.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.640
I won't allow anyone to upset you again.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.440
Your Majesty.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.000
Everyone comes from
the womb of a mother.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.000
For the continuation of life,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.600
every mother

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.040
has gone through struggles

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.080
and suffered from illnesses.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.960
What fault is there

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.160
in being a mother?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.960
Why should you be ashamed of this?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
Those ignorant rascals

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.560
should be ashamed

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.760
of joking about
illnesses from childbirth.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.080
Forget it.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.240
Girl.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.520
If it weren't for you,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.200
I would've been

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.240
too ashamed to live.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.360
You can not only heal

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.160
but say

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.920
something

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.640
so thoughtful.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.560
It must've been hard for you.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.760
Song Lingxiao,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.720
Rong Zelan,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.360
accept rewards.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.280
You two worked together

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.680
to not only cure my mother

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.960
but also loosen the knot

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.160
in her heart.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.180
Rong Zelan,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.440
you will serve in the bureau

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.800
as a first-class medical attendant
and pharmacist.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.520
Song Lingxiao, you're

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.120
promoted to
First Rank Imperial Attendant

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640
of Supervision,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.360
with access to the Study.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.640
Thank you, Your Majesty,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.760
Empress Dowager.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.000
- I'll
- I'll

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.520
certainly try my best

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.640
to repay your grace.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.960
(Rong Zelan,)

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.520
(I underestimated you.)

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.120
(You survived again.)

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.400
(A Few Days Ago)
Today, Her Majesty

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.720
dismissed everyone,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.680
and the incense in the room

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.590
was more intense than usual.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.680
When Rong Zelan took the pulse,
she requested to be alone,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640
and Her Majesty actually agreed.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.360
In the deep palace,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.600
if there is any illness

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.560
that needs to be kept secret,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.880
it must be a woman's private ailment.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
That incense

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.720
is probably to cover up the smell.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.920
Rong Zelan, well done.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.040
Spread rumors
about Her Majesty's illness

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.240
throughout the palace.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.560
Remember,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.280
the bigger the commotion, the better.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.800
Aye.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.560
Lord Feng, your hands

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.280
are steadier than before.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.840
Your Grace is of noble status.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.520
I'll

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.760
certainly spare no effort.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.740
Rong Zelan

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.440
has escaped death several times,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.840
and now

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.680
she's gained the favor of Her Majesty.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.280
I'm afraid

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.720
she might ruin your plan.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.320
Why should we fear?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.400
She wants to climb higher,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.920
so let's lend her a helping hand.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.080
First Princess Consort
is about to give birth.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.200
This is the perfect opportunity.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.360
Your Grace, you mean...

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.120
Use obstructed labor

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.360
to get rid of her.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.240
She'll find out sooner or later

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.680
that I'm the one
who caused her mother's death.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.920
She'll definitely seek revenge.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.560
Now she's clinging to Her Majesty

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.840
because she needs more support.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.680
She wants to climb higher,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.080
and the royal bloodline
will be her best ladder.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.640
Once she gets involved
in the childbirth matter,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.560
find a way to cause

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.440
problems with the fetus.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.000
In this way,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.880
we can not only cut off
the bloodline of the First Prince

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.880
but also remove a major threat.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.830
Brilliant plan, Your Grace.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.480
Please rest assured.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.280
I'll certainly handle it well for you.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.080
For the future

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.120
of Your Grace and the Second Prince,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.480
I'm willing

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.800
to do anything.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.640
Greetings, Your Grace.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.880
Don't be polite.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.080
Have a seat.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.960
You must be wondering

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.680
why I summoned you here today.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.960
Yes.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.900
Your Grace, you'd wanted
to expel me from the palace.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.040
I thought you disliked me.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.100
However, when my life was at risk,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.020
you pleaded for me.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.040
I've been so puzzled.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.800
Everyone out.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.600
Zelan.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.360
Your mother and I

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.200
were once close friends.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.720
That day, in Her Majesty's room,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.440
I learned about your identity

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.280
and was very surprised.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.160
I knew you didn't enter the palace

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.080
just to become a medical attendant.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.880
However, everything is

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.400
complicated in the palace.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.680
One mistake,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.640
and you'll fall into the abyss.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.440
I don't want you
to end up like your mother.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.960
I've failed her already.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.440
I cannot let anything happen

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.800
to her only child!

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.680
That's why
I've tried to expel you many times.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.440
Your Grace,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.720
do you know something about my mother?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.280
Could you tell me

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.240
the cause of her death?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.360
Back then,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.520
I got pregnant soon

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.400
after coming here.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.160
Your mother often came to
the palace to visit me.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.440
Later,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.840
Consort Ning feared
that I'd give birth to a prince

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.960
and threaten her position,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040
so she devised a scheme

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.280
to get rid of the baby.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.600
Your mother saw through the plot

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.640
and saved me.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.040
However,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.600
she offended Consort Ning
because of this.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.440
That's why

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.040
she was framed and died unjustly!

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.800
It's her.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.000
I'll definitely find the evidence

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.800
and make her pay the price

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.040
with blood!

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.380
Zelan!

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.630
Consort Ning holds
overwhelming power in the palace,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.940
and her father

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.480
is the Guardian Grand General

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.440
who controls the army.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.760
Now you're only a medical attendant.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.360
How's it possible to overturn the case?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.560
I'm afraid

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.840
you'd only die in vain.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.360
Zelan.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.520
Promise me.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.480
Leave the palace right away.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.200
Your mother

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.000
wouldn't want you to take risks.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.160
She'd only want you to live

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.160
a peaceful life.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.400
Your Grace,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.400
I can't leave.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.000
As a medical attendant,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.800
I'm even more aware

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.760
of the injustice my mother

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.240
suffered in the medical field.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.240
I must find evidence

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.400
to expose the crimes of Consort Ning

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.360
and clear my mother's name.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.840
I'll also become a medical officer

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.280
to break the prejudice
that women can't practice medicine.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.280
This is

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.360
the best proof for my mother.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.640
Attendant Rong.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.800
Lord Song.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.960
Looking for Minister Wu?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.080
Minister Wu caught a cold

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.160
and just went back.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.880
I'm here to see you.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.080
Me?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.080
Yes.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.360
What do you need?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.960
Since the first time we met,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.280
I've had a feeling

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.420
that you're not

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.680
a simple medical attendant.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.360
Not long ago, I happened to overhear

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.320
the conversation
between you and Consort Rou

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.880
and learned why you entered the palace

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.120
and

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.000
who the enemy is.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.440
You eavesdropped?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.640
- I...
- Are you going to

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.560
report me to Consort Ning?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.080
I'm here to

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.920
seek cooperation.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.880
I already know

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
your true purpose.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.720
To show my sincerity,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.880
I'll also tell you

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.920
the truth.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.680
I'm the son of
the First Princess and Marquis Xuanping.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.480
I joined the bureau to investigate

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.960
the successive deaths
of the imperial children.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.560
Go ahead.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.720
Rong Zelan.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.320
I'm a princess's son.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.360
Aren't you even surprised?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.280
Get to the point.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.080
Okay.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.000
The point is,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.720
based on my investigation these days,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.640
I suspect that Consort Ning

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.000
is the mastermind behind this.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.400
Now that we share the same goal,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.810
rather than fighting alone,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.190
we should work together.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.840
What do you think?

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.600
Okay.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.080
Glad to work with you.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.480
Glad to work with you.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.120
Glad to work with you.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.200
I thought you'd refuse me.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.760
Lord Song.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.280
Greetings, Grandmother.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.340
(First Princess Consort)
Get up.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.280
You're pregnant.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.440
No need for courtesy.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.240
Come here and sit down.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.880
Talk with me.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.440
Well,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.720
I'm trapped here all day,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.900
feeling so restless.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.520
Grandmother,

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.920
seeing you in such good spirits,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.380
I feel

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.240
so delighted.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.520
You look a bit pale today.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.500
Are you

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.590
feeling unwell?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.480
I'll summon the physician over

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.400
to take your pulse.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.160
Grandmother.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.620
It's just that

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.120
I've been a bit tired lately.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.160
It's nothing serious.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.600
I only need to rest for a few days.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.160
(Her Highness seems
to have a hidden illness.)

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.040
(This is a rare opportunity.)

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.480
(I have to cure
more women in the palace)

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.880
(to show people)

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.520
(that female physicians
are necessary in the palace.)

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.560
Your Majesty,

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.520
I wonder if I can check on Her Highness.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.920
Attendant Rong

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.020
has been taking care of me,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.080
and I'm much better now.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.520
Let her check on you as well.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.400
Your Highness,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.640
don't be nervous.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.360
Prepare the medicine according to

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.720
this prescription every day.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.640
It can replenish energy and blood.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.920
Aye.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800
Your Highness,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.960
if someone sends novel food or items,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.800
examine them carefully before using.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.280
After all, there are
too many people in the palace,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.120
and gifts may come from
all kinds of sources.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.080
It's possible

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.880
that something inappropriate
might be mixed among them.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520
Thank you, Attendant Rong.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.960
I'll be careful.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.720
Your Highness, no need to thank me.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.160
This is my duty.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.520
Then I shall take my leave.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.000
Lord Song,

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.280
why are you here?

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.040
I came to take
Her Majesty's peace pulse.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.040
Can you do that?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.400
Maybe I can.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.720
(Maybe I should change)

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.240
(the prescription)

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.440
(for Her Highness's illness.)

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.200
Something's wrong!

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.640
Premature childbirth!

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.800
It is critical!

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.320
The Eastern Palace urgently summoned
everyone from the bureau!

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.520
(Oh, no!)

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.800
(I knew it.)
