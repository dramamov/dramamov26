This time,

you've got nowhere to hide.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160
Stay here, Pa.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.720
Or you'll get caught in the crossfire.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.320
I'm gonna straighten you out.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.040
So?

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.960
Not so tough anymore, are you?

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480
Run on the count of three.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.240
In the blink of an eye,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.880
the tables have turned.

What are you doing?

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.140
Don't do anything crazy.
I'm a guard here.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.480
That's why they call me the Rabid Dog.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.360
I always do real crazy stuff.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Don't you fucking know?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.960
One...

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.200
Two...

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.800
Three!

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.160
- Hey! After her!
- Stop!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.840
- Duen!
- Go!

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.720
Guards!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.480
- Guards!
- Stop!

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.400
Let go of me! What the hell?!

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.600
Be quiet!

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.000
- Let go!
- Stay still.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.320
You're full of tricks, aren't you?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.040
Let go!

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.920
- Your shoe!
- Oh!

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.720
- Let me go!
- Stay still!

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240
Let go...

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.880
Oh...

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
I've made up my mind.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.560
Call the other guards.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.240
Drag her to our cell.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.440
Don't do it here.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.360
Come on!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.880
- Quit being pretentious!
- Come here!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.520
I told you to call the guards!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.720
Code 17, situation 200!

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.440
What?!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.360
What do we do, sis?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.200
Bell!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240
What should we do?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.040
What do we do?!

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.640
- What happened?!
- Stop!

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.080
Hold it!

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.440
Stop them!

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.760
- Stop!
- Hands over your head!

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.680
What's going on?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360
How did the inmates get out?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.680
Kneel.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.880
- Kneel!
- Get on the ground!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.520
She forgot something.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.160
Stop!

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.600
On the ground!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.040
Get down!

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.280
On the ground!

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.540
Get on the ground!

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.440
Now!

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880
All of you!

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.760
On the ground!

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.200
Get on the ground!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.440
Hands behind your back!

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.240
You enjoy causing trouble, don't you?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720
[Visiting Day]

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.760
So what on earth happened?

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.640
Didn't you hear the question?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.000
What happened?!

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.600
These inmates had a fight
in front of the cells last night.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.440
So how did they manage
to get out of their cells?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.680
You just got out of solitary

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.640
and already caused trouble?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.480
What happened to your head?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.720
Popped a pimple.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.880
You find it funny, do n't you?

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.920
Very well.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.480
Stand here until someone reveals the truth.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.880
You, come and see me at my office.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
Get inmate Dao too.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.840
I assigned you to take care of the inmates,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.400
but your sisters got into a fight.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.800
Inmates settling a problem
with one another is nothing new.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.280
It's the incompetent guard

00:06:09.313 --> 00:06:11.033
- who has to take responsibility.
- I said when I got there,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.560
they were already fighting!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.360
So how did your baton end up inside a cell?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.000
Oh...

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.640
You're the one who nearly got
strangled to death by the Rabid Dog, right?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.680
You must've held a real deep grudge, right?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.960
Perhaps the reason you radioed for backup

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.960
was because you couldn't handle Claire.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.160
What nonsense did you just say?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.080
How would I do that?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.920
Cell doors don't open by themselves.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.000
Only the guards can unlock them!

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.520
Who the hell do you think you are, inmate?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.560
I'm a guard, remember?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.600
If you're just an incompetent guard,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.000
you're just as shitty as a prisoner like me.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.880
Sir, are you going to
allow her to say such things?

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.800
Your mouth deserves a taste of my baton!

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.720
Stop!

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.040
Shut it, both of you.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.720
I'm giving you a chance to say the truth

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.040
before checking the CCTV footage myself.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.720
The Rabid Dog...

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.440
She has violent tendencies.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.000
I simply wanted to teach her a lesson.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.560
But Deedee and the new inmate
were already having a fight.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
That has nothing to do with me.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.120
I propose transferring
the problematic inmates elsewhere

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.880
so they won't cause
any more problems here.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.000
I agree with your proposal,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.000
but the one being transferred is you.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.040
Pack up all of your stuff.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560
Sir...

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.120
- But these bastards...
- Quiet!

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.080
The only person here causing me problems

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120
is no one else but you!

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.160
Are you going to resign

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.400
or make me fire you?

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.120
I just submitted a request
to reduce your sentence.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.480
You know?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.080
If the director catches wind of this,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.040
do you know what will happen to me?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.000
Dao...

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.240
You've truly disappointed me.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.080
If something like this happens again,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.200
you and your sisters'
family visit quota this year

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.760
will be the last you'll ever get.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.700
Get it?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.960
Bell?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.760
Are you alright?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.240
Bell.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.180
Bell!

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
Weak.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.440
You saw it, right?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.880
Claire caught Bell when she fell.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.560
My eyes weren't playing tricks on me, right?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.760
Yes, I saw it, too.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.040
It's so weird.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.720
She usually doesn't interact with anyone
except Pa'Porn.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.080
Maybe she accidentally fell into her.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.560
Claire could've just stepped aside, no?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.960
If I were her,
I would've beaten the newbie up on the spot.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.920
So ruthless.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.120
- All of you, get the fuck out!
- Oh, God!

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680
Yes, sis!

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.920
Except you two.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.800
Dao...

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.760
The new inmate started it.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800
- We just...
- She did?

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.040
She did, huh?!

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.480
Are you okay? Did that hit you?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.800
Quit worrying about her!

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.840
Sit!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.840
Okay.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.840
What did I tell you?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.800
You can cause trouble

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.560
but keep the matter away from me!

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.760
You told a guard to
unlock the cells at night just to fight?

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.920
Do you think no one saw that?!

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.560
There are cameras!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.520
Wichai told me...

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.720
Should you cause any more trouble,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.360
our annual family visit quota will be revoked.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.520
How dare...

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.440
Right?!

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.920
How dare you?!

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.040
Mom could only visit us once a year.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.920
What would you do if that gets revoked?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.200
Do you still remember

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.440
what I told you after I got arrested?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.480
"Take care of Mom

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.360
and my kid!"

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.080
Yet, both of you somehow ended up here!

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.560
I've tried requesting

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.960
to reduce your time here.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.640
Don't disappoint me.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.360
It's all because of Bell.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.880
Feeling better?

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120
How are you now?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.800
Let me sprinkle some holy water on you.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.120
May it cleanse all evil from you.

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:11.793
Oh, Pa'Porn...

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.640
I just put the ointment on her.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.320
You washed it off with that holy water.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.440
I'm sorry, love.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.920
That's okay.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.280
It's okay, Pa.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.280
Perhaps that will help things get better.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.960
Kae?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.600
I need to talk to you.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.520
Come here.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.720
I'll be right back.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.040
What is it?

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.440
Is the stuff I ordered out of stock?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.680
Or do you want me to recheck the order?

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.400
Be honest.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.040
You've got a crush on the new inmate,

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.880
haven't you?

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.880
No!

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.240
N-no, not at all!

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.680
I don't have a crush on her!

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.560
What kind of question was that?

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.400
Whatever, that's up to you.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.120
However...

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.720
I think you should keep a distance from her.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.320
Deedee now wants her head.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960
After the annual family visit,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.040
if you still keep going,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.840
you'll get caught up in the trouble as well!

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.560
At that rate,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.520
I won't be able to help you.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.600
That's my son.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.120
He's going to come visit in a few days.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.040
He didn't come last year.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.080
This year, he's definitely coming!

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.040
Alright. Let's pray.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.880
Could you pass me the prayer book, love?

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.840
It's in the drawer.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.480
Huh?

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.040
How did this end up here?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.640
How?

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.640
Oh, I forgot.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.000
Claire asked me to return it to the library,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.360
but I forgot.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.360
Are you close to Claire?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.360
We share a cell, love.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.720
Of course we're close.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.560
Huh?

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.160
You're her cellmate?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.000
Yes.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.480
And...

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.080
You're not afraid she'd hurt you?

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.040
Why would I?

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.640
She's different from what everybody says.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.320
When you were being jumped,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.960
it was Claire

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
who told the new guard to radio for help.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.000
Come on. Let's pray.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.200
[Praying]

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.800
No, move it to another row.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.560
There, like that.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.360
Tie that securely.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.640
[Family Visit Day]

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.040
They're this serious about the day, huh?

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.760
It's like a New Year celebration.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.600
Mm.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.360
You know, inmates are willing to stay

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.840
just to wait for the annual family visit.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.400
♫No, no, no, I don't get
what you're trying to say♫

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.600
What's Ice Paris doing here?

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.360
He visits the prison every year.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.960
So handsome!

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.360
His sister is serving her sentence here.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.560
It's her.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.240
What was her charge?

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.480
Uh...

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.680
She shot her husband dead in a pub.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.160
She always looks pissed.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.480
Let's go.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.480
You're missing your family?

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.760
Since I was thrown into prison,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.240
I haven't told my dad about all this.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080
He's suffering from cancer,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.520
and I'm worried he'd get worse if I say it.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.540
I wonder how he's doing.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.600
Someone might visit you, you know?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.680
Right?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.880
Who's coming to see you?

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.920
My boyfriend.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.680
Oh...

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.640
You're already in a relationship?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.260
That's news to me.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.320
He's helping me with my case.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.280
That's good.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.800
I hope he comes here with good news.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.800
Thank you.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.640
What? That's all I get?

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.680
A special treatment from Deedee.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.880
Oh, my!

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.240
- Can I have some as well?
- Absolutely.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.480
Thank you very much!

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.400
I'm so tired from dancing.
I could eat a horse right now!

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.240
Yeah, give me a ton of that.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.600
That's the stuff.

00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:42.926
Can I have that, too?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.480
- Oh, thank you.
- Danced a bit too much?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.260
Yeah, I let myself go a bit too much.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.160
Oh, it's dripping.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.320
That's enough. Thank you!

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.160
- Spoons are right there.
- Thank you.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800
Good luck.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.640
Hello! Hello!

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.880
She's annoying me, Dao.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.400
She's looking so nonchalant.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.320
Deedee.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.280
If you cause trouble
and my visit gets revoked,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.160
I'll put your face on the ground.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.280
Come on. I'm not going to do anything.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.760
I'm also waiting for
my boyfriend to come and see me.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.880
Lately, he hasn't come here at all.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.600
You got arrested for prostitution.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.200
You're so lucky that he's still with you.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.600
I got arrested for extortion.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.080
Not prostitution, alright?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.880
I never sleep with someone random.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.520
Dumb men are my prime targets.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.040
Wow, so clever!

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.360
If you were that clever,
you wouldn't be in here yapping with me.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.680
Listen.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.440
If Mom comes to see us tomorrow...

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.560
Two of you,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.400
don't tell her about

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.720
the fights you've had, okay?

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.760
Just sit and say nothing.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.240
Keep your mouth shut, okay?

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.720
Understood?

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.480
Yes.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.080
Yes, sis.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.080
How's that?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.920
You're as good as you've always been.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.400
Dad?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.840
I'd like to consult you on something.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.520
My girlfriend... got arrested.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.600
I was hoping you could pull some strings

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.320
to get her out.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.640
Jade and I are working on her sentence,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.640
but with your assistance, I think...

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.520
Hey.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.280
Top, what do you even do with your life?

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.120
Aside from...

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.200
living your life carelessly

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.260
and draining my wallet?

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.280
I never blame you for that, do I?

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.680
Because I know that's
the only thing you're capable of.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.160
And you came to see me

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.000
to ask me to help your girlfriend...

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.420
You think you have that much power?

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.400
I only took Bell to her graduation party,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.360
and someone stuffed her bag with drugs.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.600
That's why she got arrested.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.800
She doesn't deserve any of this.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.320
So that's why you need my help?

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.280
Yes.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.080
So how do you want me to help you?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.560
Help you take her place in jail?

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.000
- Dad...
- Do you know

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.040
what else they've found aside from drugs?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.400
This!

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.040
Your car key.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.320
Do you know how much
I had to pay to get it back?

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.480
Also, do you know that

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.200
if anyone else finds out about this,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.840
besides you,

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.200
who exactly will be in hot water?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.880
It'll be me, damn it!

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.000
Jade is one of my men.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.200
I ordered him

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.240
to tell your girlfriend to confess.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.800
Why did you...

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.560
Remember this.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.120
The only good thing
you possess in your life is

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.160
my surname

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.840
attached to your name.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.760
I will not let you

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.800
taint my reputation.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.040
So stop thinking about this.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.960
Let your girlfriend

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.640
suffer her fate behind bars.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.000
Aw...

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.840
I'm going to starve to death tonight.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.840
I should've supplied myself
with snacks from the shop.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.680
I'm sorry.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.160
I made things difficult for you.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.600
I'll treat you to snacks tomorrow.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.840
That's okay.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.880
It's not your fault.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.720
Let's just say I'm fasting, okay?

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160
So I get leaner.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.380
Uh...

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.380
Should I apologize to Deedee?

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.400
You can try.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.120
She wouldn't dare touch you
during the family visit.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.700
Her boyfriend's coming to see her.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.840
After this, however,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.200
she's gonna continue to beat you up.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.420
Believe me.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.220
What happened, love?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.520
I'll be fine, Pa.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.920
It'll heal soon.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.680
See?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.080
There's no blood.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.320
Right, let's get your blood pressure lowered

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.280
so you can tend to the plants tomorrow.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.400
Those are my medicine...

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.880
Why do you keep it with you, love?

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.800
It's so you can call me more often.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.480
This way, we won't forget each other.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.360
Okay. Open your mouth.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.720
Poor Bell...

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.800
Just got here and already getting bullied.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.680
Just like when you first came.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.880
You got it wrong.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.640
Who'd dare hurt me?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.080
I forgot, love.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.400
Who'd dare cross the Rabid Dog?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.040
They'd catch rabies if they did.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.600
You failed your internship?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.640
I've never heard of anyone who did.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.480
They said I was too strict,

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.560
and not flexible.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.640
It's not just that, right?

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.120
I also had a problem
with the department head.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.140
Just what were you thinking?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.720
You had beef with the department head?

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.760
I was assigned to look after
the company's finances.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.400
The numbers were incorrect,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.760
so I issued a report.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.320
They called the head of the department,

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.680
and the anger was taken out on me.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.920
This is "not knowing how to play the game."

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.120
Some matters are best not brought up.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.560
I think office jobs might not suit you.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.520
How about another line of work?

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.680
Honey.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.240
If he's this lacking,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.880
no matter the field of work,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.320
he won't be able to go far.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Honey.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.980
You told me that a guard just resigned, right?

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.160
Mm...

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200
Just have him work with you.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.720
You'll get to show him the ropes, too.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.760
You want me to become a prison guard?

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.200
Oh, right.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.440
This line of work doesn't suit Porches.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.880
You told him to give it a try, didn't you?

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.160
How would he know whether or not he likes it?

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.760
Just teach him stuff.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.000
Plus, a women's prison
isn't that dangerous, right?

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.400
Are you going to let him go on his own,

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.400
achieving nothing?

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.360
Can't you do this for the sake of our son?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.000
Me? I'm not interested in that job.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.480
Just quit if you don't like it.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.440
No more words.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.280
Oh...

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.920
Okay.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.040
I'll look into it.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.280
Yeah, it's simple as that.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.480
Eat well, honey.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.520
Have some of this as well.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.760
Don't forget to eat the fish

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.160
so that you talk less.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.920
Oh, sorry!

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.080
I mean, so that you...

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.600
It's good for your health.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.760
Today is the annual family visit day.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.640
I hope everything goes well.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.000
I know how long
you've been waiting for this day.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920
So...

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.960
Please abide by the rules

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.920
so that this occasion
can happen again for years to come.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.960
Understood?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.640
Understood!

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.480
As you may know,

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.320
recently, a guard has been transferred.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.960
So...

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.040
We needed a new guard in her place.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.320
Please treat him with respect

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.000
just like how you do to other guards.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.880
I might not be your type,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.600
but you'll fall for my words!

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.480
Hey! Silence!

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.880
Stop with the loud noises.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.280
This is a prison,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.860
not your home.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.280
Porches here

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.280
is a guard,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.320
not your friend.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.280
Understood?!

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.800
Understood.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.400
Wait until a guard
calls your name for the visit.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.080
You may leave now.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.160
Go!

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200
I told you to leave!

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.200
Leave!

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.000
He's totally my type.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.920
Working here...

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.160
Don't tell anyone you're my son.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.200
It'll look bad.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.120
They'll say I cheated you here.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.120
This new guard...

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.560
He looks kind of naive, no?

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.040
Usually, when Wichai deploys new guards,

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.200
he doesn't announce who they are.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.680
Why did he introduce the guy to us?

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.460
It's none of your business.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.320
Just behave, okay?

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.720
The following is a list of inmates
who have visitors.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.560
If your name is called, proceed to visitation.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.440
Inmate Pia.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.720
Inmate Dao.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.280
Inmate Duen.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.680
Inmate Deedee.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.860
Yes!

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.800
Let's go.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160
- Karakade, the mirror.
- Oh, here you go.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.440
It's right here.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.960
- Do I look pretty?
- You look the best.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.840
I'll make sure I'll dazzle him.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.120
Yes, sis.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.840
Inmate Mathusorn.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.840
Inmate Karakade.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.760
My boyfriend! I'm coming!

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.180
Inmate Mangpor.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.960
Inmate Kae.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.120
Over here.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.560
Inmate Wann.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.120
Inmate Beam.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.160
Inmate Som.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.760
['Kai Hua Roh']

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.120
Mom!

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.000
Come on!

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.080
I miss you!

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.360
Hello, Auntie.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.360
Deedee, why did you put makeup on?

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.440
What's up with you?

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.720
Have you been doing well, Mom?

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.880
It's been alright.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.520
It's quite a hassle to come here, though.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.080
I had to be driven here.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.760
These two are gonna be out soon.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.080
The request is pending.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.040
As for me, I'll follow a bit later, okay?

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.720
Damn you, Dao.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.160
You were freed last time,

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.880
and now you're back in here again.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.520
What did you like about this place, huh?

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560
Duen.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800
Aren't you going to say a word to your mother?

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.760
Dao told me

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.120
to keep my mouth shut.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.360
I came all the way here,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.280
yet you chose to be quiet?

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.120
What's gotten into you, Duen?

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.480
Where's my Man, Aunt Shri?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.480
Huh? Hasn't anybody told you?

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680
About what?

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.800
Your boyfriend Man found a new girl!

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.480
Her name is...

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.880
It's Sai or something.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.520
They met on an app called 'Thinner.'

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.920
Isn't that for paint?

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.040
What? Come on!

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.960
News broke, she left, just like that!

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.080
You still can't get used to her?

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.240
Wait.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.720
If it's not him, then who drove you here?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880
Boom.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.200
Boom did?!

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.240
He can drive now?

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.640
Where is he, then?

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.560
He's waiting in the car.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.770
He said he didn't want to see his mother.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.970
It's just you here again?

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.160
Mm.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.480
Others are busy.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:40.750
Are they busy or are they avoiding me?

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:41.970
Well...

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.380
I was just kidding!

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.110
You got pale for a bit there.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.080
And... the books I told you to donate here,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.400
have you gotten to them?

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.780
The gardening books?

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.370
The officers just picked them up.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.450
Okay. That's good.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.500
Is this what you're into now?

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.980
I can't imagine you planting trees.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.430
Who says it's me?

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.780
Just do what I say.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.710
Don't bother asking me questions.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.840
Honestly, Kae...

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.820
Can you just be nice to us for once?

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.370
We always give you the cut.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.460
You always talk to us like we're not friends.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:34.440
Friends?

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.740
If we're friends,
why am I the only one behind bars?

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.950
How about we swap places?

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.530
Take all of my cut

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and stay here instead of me.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.490
How's that sound, huh?

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.880
Quit saying we're friends.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:57.260
Your job is to give me the monthly cut

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.890
and do what I say.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.220
Or else, I'll rat you all out.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.820
Understood?

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.890
Does he have a girlfriend,

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.420
or has he gotten someone pregnant?

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.640
What the hell, Duen?!

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.090
Boom is different from the rest of us.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.620
He's much smarter.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.440
If he's that smart,
why don't you raise him yourself?

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.000
It's fine, you raise him.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.730
I have nothing to teach him.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:33.410
Oh? Boom! Come and see your mom.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.690
Damn it! Come on!

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.930
It's too hot in the car, so I came here.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.100
They don't allow you
to keep the engine running here.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.980
Why would you say that, huh?

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.220
That's okay.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.300
Are you doing well, Boom?

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.610
Pretty well.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.480
Deedee's gone for too long.
I'll go and find her.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.130
I'm sorry.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.000
It's been a while, hasn't it?
You've grown!

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.000
Grandma said you're about to
complete junior high school, right?

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.830
Listen. Don't worry.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.730
I'll pay for high school.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.960
With prison money?

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.570
I've actually got work here, too, Boom.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.400
I work in the kitchen, and they pay me.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.990
I just couldn't withdraw it yet.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.700
I actually didn't want to come,

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.010
but someone had to drive Grandma here.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.890
Damn it! How dare you say that?

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.770
It's fine, Mom.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.490
Seeing you already makes me happy.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.040
Boom.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.800
I'm sorry.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.570
Sorry for leaving you to Grandma.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.120
It's fine.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.860
Honestly, living with her is okay.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.250
She's a bit grumpy, but don't mind her, okay?

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.050
She taught me to be a good person

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.770
and not to cause trouble... like you did.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.280
Let's go, Grandma. I'm hungry.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.290
What's with you?

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.130
We just got here.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.320
It's okay.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.870
It's fine, Mom.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.000
It's too hot in here.
You should go now.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.290
Listen. Come and see me next time, okay?

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:53.950
What is it, love?

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:58.380
Maybe your son is stuck in traffic.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.370
I think so.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.340
I've been waiting for a whole year.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.590
Guess it's fine to wait a little longer.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.140
Where are you going?

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.690
I'm going to apologize to Deedee,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.010
so that everything clears up.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.770
This type of person doesn't let things go.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.200
It's fine.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.330
Trust me.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.420
Deedee.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.220
I don't know if I've done something wrong,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.160
but if I made you upset...

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.750
I didn't mean to do it.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.210
That's why I want to apologize.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:46.770
You have a death wish, don't you?

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.650
What makes you think I'd forgive you?

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.840
You just met your boyfriend, didn't you?

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.940
So I think you'd be in a good mood.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.300
What the hell did you say?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.730
You just met your boyfriend, didn't you?

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.010
Damn you!

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.290
He's left me for a new girl.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.970
Why did you have to rub it in, huh?!

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:09.890
Oh...

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.190
Deedee, Deedee...

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.800
Dao told us not to cause problems.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.330
Guards are everywhere.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.660
You won't make it past tonight, Bell.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.750
We should go now!

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:21.600
Gosh!

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.150
Are you alright, love?

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.570
Aw...

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.580
Are you good?

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.120
Poor girl.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.020
You should go to the library.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.490
Claire should be there.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.410
She can help if you're in trouble.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.540
Sure.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.510
It's too dangerous here.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.880
Please go, love.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.400
Go to the library.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.740
Phew.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.900
Have a safe trip home, Mom.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.390
Babe, eat more food! You're losing weight!

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.840
But you're not eating with me!

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.840
Babe!

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.590
Don't make that face!
My heart's tearing to pieces!

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.700
I'm sorry, babe. I won't do it again.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.960
You can have as many girls as you want.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.800
You can have a harem, but don't leave me!

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.190
Babe, you eat with friends,
but I have to eat alone!

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.270
Aw, you poor thing, babe.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.650
I feel so sorry for you.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.960
It's time to leave.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.230
Can we have a bit more time?

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.940
Don't be mad at me, babe!

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.880
Is your heart still okay?

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.120
Babe!

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200
What?!

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.660
What is it, Duen?

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.610
We have to go now.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.240
You never had a man or something?

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.070
Babe, let go!

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.590
It's time for me to go!

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.370
I refuse!

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.770
Babe!

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.280
It's getting awkward! Let me go!

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.750
Forever!

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.830
Mathusorn, I'm counting to ten,
get your ass up!

00:38:10.963 --> 00:38:13.623
- Sis! Mathusorn is being a bad girl!
- I'll go after the countdown!

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.160
Bell.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.670
Can you help me carry books?

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.600
We've received a ton of donated books.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.980
- Right now?
- Mm.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.580
What books?

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.450
I think they're about gardening.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:43.680
Kae's friend donated them.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.530
Mm, sure.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.650
Are we good to go?

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.110
Come on.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.810
Where are the other inmates?

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.650
Nobody really comes here.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.300
It leads to the old toilet.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.120
Rumor has it that someone heard
a woman scream from there.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.060
Follow me.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.400
Quickly.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.560
What are you doing?

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.700
Come and help me.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:29.840
We can wait for Kae first.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.100
No need! It's only a few boxes.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.090
Look at this. The guards are so lazy.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.520
We need to pick the boxes up ourselves.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.640
Whoa, we can't carry
this many books ourselves.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.530
Should we get some more helping hands?

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.970
Mangpor?

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.150
Mangpor!

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.500
Mangpor's gone.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.890
It's just you and me.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.340
Hello!

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.650
Whoa.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.970
So it's not just the two of us.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.940
We've got two more.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:24.800
- Hey, where are you going?
- What's the hurry, girl?

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.220
Where do you think you're going?

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.050
Deedee, I'm sorry.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.780
I don't know what I've done.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.950
I'll do anything you want.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.620
I really don't want trouble.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.090
But I do.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:36.700
I wanna beat your sorry ass.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.760
That's for making me get scolded by Dao!

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.580
Hold up!

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.540
How about a punch in the gut instead?

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.490
There.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.140
That's for rubbing salt in the wound
about my boyfriend.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.010
Pick her up!

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.420
- More.
- Sis, wait.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.980
Wait! I think that's enough.
She's learned her lesson.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.190
I'm not done.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.580
- If Dao knows about this...
- There are no cameras here!

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.330
The same goes for the guards.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.900
How would she know if nobody snitches?

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.580
Or are you going to tell her yourself?

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.890
- Ah!
- Hey! Hey!

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.020
Blood!

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.540
Ah! Sis! Here!

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:18.780
She scratched me!

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.210
- Bell! Bell!
- Stop!

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.600
Come on, girls!

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.430
Bell! Stop!

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.340
Mathusorn, what are you doing here?

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.230
This way! Come on!

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.590
Oh, dear!

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.380
Follow me!

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:52.970
Sis...

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.170
Move it!

00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.920
Go and have a look.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.160
Don't just stand there.
Go inside!

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.720
Can I... not go in?

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.100
I'm scared of ghosts.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.740
They say a ghost will follow us if we go in!

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:12.590
Ah!

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.570
You cowards. It's just rumors.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.260
Duen, you take the lead.
They'll follow.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.930
- Oh, what a relief!
- This way, Duen.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.090
Let's go.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.440
- Ah!
- No...

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.740
I've also heard loud noises coming from there.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.090
We'll all go in at once.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.210
Move it!

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.810
Okay, moving!

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.590
Where are you going?

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.880
It's here!

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.160
What? Why'd you jump when you see me?

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.370
What happened to your face?

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.570
I got scratched by a branch in the courtyard.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.080
I was a bit careless.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.890
Oh?

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.620
They look more like nail scratches.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.980
Don't let me catch you causing trouble again.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.220
Keep going!

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.620
Inside?

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.340
Out, damn it! Why should we enter the toilet?

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:30.330
Come on.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.610
How did you get here?

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.000
You scared me to death.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.440
I borrowed a book only for a bit,

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.040
and you come all the way here to fetch it?

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.300
The laugh of a ghost...

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.740
It came from you?

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:39.960
Have a seat.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.020
Mm.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.620
Capybara.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.930
Huh?

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.700
The cat's name is Capybara.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.390
I thought you liked eating cat food.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:25.940
Nonsense.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.990
Why would I?

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.040
Well, it's what they say.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.560
They say you love eating cat food,

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:40.270
and you're so ruthless that
they all call you Rabid Dog.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:41.970
So am I a dog,

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.250
or a cat?

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:49.900
Want some?

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.200
I only eat the crust.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:24.770
Thank you for helping me.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.120
When we were standing in the sun?

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.790
You fell into me.

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.440
It would've been too mean not to help, right?

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:41.440
That, too.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.180
But also, thank you for helping me
when I got jumped by the 3Ds.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.560
Pa'Porn told me that

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.840
you told the guard to radio for others.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.250
How did someone like you end up in prison?

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.850
Actually, I shouldn't end up here.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.250
I studied so hard

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.270
and hoped that I'd get a good job

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:25.300
so that I could afford
to treat my dad's cancer.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.730
Then I graduated...

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.860
Before I could even
get to attend the ceremony,

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.820
I got arrested
because someone planted drugs in my bag.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.930
I don't even dare
to tell my dad about all this.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.320
I'm worried he'd get worse.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.400
I'm not sleeping, by the way.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.420
I'm just resting my eyes.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.200
Keep going.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:16.590
That's about it.

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.840
If crying makes you feel better,

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.560
just let it out.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:35.780
But if you're done crying,

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.030
read it for some good laughs.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.360
So you forget those dark times.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.180
Don't cry on the book, though.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.490
I borrowed it.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:07.020
Mm.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.350
Hey.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.570
You also work on the family visit day?

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:28.690
- Huh?
- The packages arrived, you see.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.200
I need to make deliveries,
or I'll lose my credit.

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.900
It's a dud.

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.480
Here's one more.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.920
There you go.

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:43.320
What happened to you?

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.100
Did Bell...

00:49:45.147 --> 00:49:47.017
Hey, that's my cream, right?

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.730
I'll take it right now.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.800
- Put it away.
- Sure, sis.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.690
So?

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.660
I've heard that the sale's doing well.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.000
It doesn't do that well, really.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:15.210
Inmates are prohibited from smoking.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.630
I'll catch you later, Mangpor.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:27.610
Right, Dao.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.540
What smoking? I see no cigarettes here.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.000
Exactly.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.250
Nobody's smoking. Are you accusing me?

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.250
Abusing your power
won't do you good, you know?

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.980
If you don't stop,
I'll report this to the warden.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.250
I've also got something to report.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.640
A male guard entered
the female inmate unit without authorization...

00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:57.136
He even came here by himself,
that's against the rules!

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.260
I have a female guard with me.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.210
Hm, where?

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.070
Are they under the tub?

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.400
Is this against the regulations?

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.940
He even touched me inappropriately, Dao.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:11.770
Hey!

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.730
I can vouch for that.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.930
Yeah, I saw that with my two eyes.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.920
Oh, with this many witnesses,
what would you do?

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.580
Your name is Porches, right?

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:23.120
You're new here,
you might not know how this place works.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.040
But I think you do now, don't you?

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.730
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't forget to come to see us again!

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.500
- He looked so upset.
- Bye-bye!

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.790
Bell! Bell!

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.850
Top! Where have you been?

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:42.930
You need to help me.

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.210
Don't worry. I'll find a way to help you.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.200
The cops found a ton of drugs in your bag.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.360
So they're gonna charge you with...

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.030
- Drug dealing.
- Drug dealing?!

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.820
Where would I even get them from?

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.080
- I don't even know where they came from.
- I know.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.020
In any case, we'll help you
to the fullest extent.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.610
However, we must admit that
trying to get rid of the evidence

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.600
makes it harder to defend you.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.530
You told me to throw them away.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.420
Bell...

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.140
I didn't...

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.050
They weren't mine. I have no clue.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.770
I'm sorry.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:34.330
Tell the cops that you advised me to do it.

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:35.440
I have nothing to do with the drugs.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.000
By the way, I'm Jade.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:38.850
I'm your attorney.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.860
If he does that, he will be charged
with obstructing an officer as well.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.070
At any rate, you're not free from this case.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.130
You should plead guilty.

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.900
This will mitigate your sentence.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:03.560
Sorry, it is not possible to reach
the number you've dialed at this moment.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:12.920
Has anybody come to visit me?

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.420
I don't think there's any.

00:54:50.683 --> 00:54:53.713
Pa, why are you sitting here all by yourself?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.440
Your son still hasn't arrived?

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.730
He's still not here.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.550
He must've forgotten about me.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:05.170
Uh...

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.610
Maybe he's caught up with work
like my boyfriend does.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.260
He also couldn't visit.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:16.640
We can meet them
at regular visit times, right?

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.210
Inmate Claire, you have a visitor.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.430
Please hurry up.
The visitation hour is over soon.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.750
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:00.900
Here, this one's for free.

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.840
Pa?

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.610
What do you mean by free?

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.710
Why not?

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.450
Just cut it from my wage.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.540
I don't spend the money anyway.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:11.840
Are you high or something?

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.370
You don't even work here anymore.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:16.130
What do you mean by cutting from your wage?

00:56:18.350 --> 00:56:19.250
Really?

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.680
Stop coming here.

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:46.970
No matter how many times you ask,

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:50.130
my answer is always the same.

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.760
Well, your answer...

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.900
It's not reasonable.

00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:03.630
That's why I'm serving my sentence.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.580
What else do you want?

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.660
I want the truth.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.870
Perhaps, the answer is dead simple.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.120
I needed money.

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:14.360
So I committed robbery.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.840
Unfortunately, your brother caught me.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:22.650
So I had to kill him.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.140
That's all.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:26.900
Stop wasting your time.

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:29.560
He won't come back to life anyway.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.590
Go live your life.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.250
Bell, I think you should stay away for now.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.530
Huh? Why?

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.530
Trust me. This isn't the time.

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.040
Guys, a round of applause for our celebrity!

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.050
I just realized that you're a celebrity.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:14.000
What? You and your boyfriend are on TV, see?

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.610
I have to admit that the drug case suspect
used to date my son.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.930
However, they broke up
before the incident occurred.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:26.280
Therefore, my son and I

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.200
are not related to the girl's cause of action.

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.900
Mr. Top, you really
didn't know about all this before?

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:34.270
What's the truth?

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.010
I found out about it
at the same time as everyone else.

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.020
After breaking up,
we didn't see each other again.

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:49.070
Aw, a breakup broadcast live on TV?

00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:50.930
My heart bleeds for you.

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.540
As a representative of the people

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.630
and as a father,

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.050
I affirm that

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:05.150
I will absolutely not abuse my authority
to protect or assist any criminal.

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:06.900
Please rest assured.

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.260
That's all I have to say.

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.740
- Mr. Top!
- Mr. Top! What about...

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.330
Mr. Top!

00:59:21.026 --> 00:59:21.946
Bell! Bell!

00:59:22.146 --> 00:59:22.696
Bell!

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.330
- Kae!
- Grab her!

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.080
Hey! Deedee! How could you do this?!

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.780
Please don't!

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.760
- Fight!
- Stay out of this.

00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:36.580
Fight! Fight!

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.890
Kae, it's none of your business.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.700
I haven't had my revenge
for scratching my face.

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.000
What are you doing?!

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.840
A fight broke out. Need backup.

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.620
Bell!

00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:59.820
Dao, I didn't do anything.

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.060
You didn't?!

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.890
I warned you not to mess
with the Rabid Dog, did I fucking not?!

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.850
We haven't done anything, though.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:09.970
You haven't?

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.600
Take a good fucking look!

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.010
Pa'Porn!

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:16.010
Pa'Porn! Are you okay?

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:18.860
She'll definitely come for you
for messing with her people.
