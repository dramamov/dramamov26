=Episode 22=

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.550
What's the matter?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.110
My Lady,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.670
these are shops under the name
of the Commander.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.280
A total of eight.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.440
They're all located
on the most bustling Zhuque Street.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.660
There are also estates
under the name of the Commander.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.030
Two are in the Capital City.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.690
The other two are outside the Capital.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.100
Every year there is a great harvest.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.150
The profits are very good.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.750
There are also silver notes
under the Commander's name

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.430
as well as all the gold and silver
he has deposited over the years.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.940
A total of more than 70,000 taels.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.440
There are also houses
under his name

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.430
and various rare treasures
bestowed by His Majesty over the years.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.590
Altogether more than 300 items
of all sizes.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.070
And then? What are you going to do?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.560
The Commander has transferred
all of his property

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.870
under your name.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.140
The land deeds and house deeds
have also been changed to your name.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.120
And these rare treasures.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.290
Contracts for gifting them
have also been written.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.640
The Commander now has nothing left.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.560
Nothing left?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.350
Why did he give all these things to me?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.710
The Commander just asked me
to give them to you.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.640
I don't want them. Take them back.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.340
I'm only responsible
for delivering them.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.200
If it hasn't been delivered,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.940
the Commander will definitely
not spare me.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.120
If you don't want it,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.350
return it to the Commander yourself.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.400
Mohan!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.040
I...

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.540
(Xiangyue Restaurant)

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.270
Your Highness,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.240
someone from the Mansion
came to let you go back.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.430
Let's hurry back.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.540
Let me be alone for a while.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.280
Your Highness, if you return late,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.360
the Prince might not spare you.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.960
Let's go.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.920
Be careful.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.150
I heard

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.800
Prince Feng had an affair
with another man's wife.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.470
Silver filled the woman's house.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.150
Prince Feng appears to be a gentleman,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.710
but unexpectedly,
he is also a romantic man.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.590
Previously,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.360
the Prince even forcibly married a woman
who had divorced her husband.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.680
He is really not a good person.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.590
Your Highness.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.710
Have you met...

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.680
What did you just say?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.120
She is the Princess.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.800
The Princess...

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.940
What nonsense are you saying?

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.810
Say that to me again.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.250
Your Highness, spare my life.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.800
I also heard it from others.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.360
This news has now spread
throughout all of the city.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.910
Why don't you listen?

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.310
Go, go, go.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.470
Your Highness.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
Do you know

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.030
the Prince spent 10,000 taels of gold

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.870
to build a residence for his beauty?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750
This residence must be made
entirely of gold.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.470
He always met with that woman

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.240
when her husband was away.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.220
This really is knowing a face
but not the heart.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.360
It is said

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.870
he and that woman
were childhood sweethearts.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.710
Alas.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.280
What a pity.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.000
They were a pair of lovers
fated to be apart.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.680
(Storytelling venue)

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.560
Later,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.150
after this woman left him,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.800
unexpectedly, the Prince
went to find her.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.950
You must have also heard rumors
about my uncle recently,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.600
saying he has embezzled and accepted
many taels of silver,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.830
and he harbors ill intentions.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.480
Anyway, there are all kinds of rumors.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.750
These memorials

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.190
are all for me to handle this matter.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.160
What do you think?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.440
If that is the case,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.530
I believe it would be better
to take this opportunity

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.310
to investigate the Prince
openly and justly

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.030
in the name
of investigating all officials.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.720
Since such rumors exist,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.830
they are not without basis.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.360
It can also eliminate hidden threats
in the court.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.190
You're using this rumor tactic

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.680
quite well.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.830
Well? Has the Commander returned?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.800
My Lady, I have already checked
three times.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.490
The Commander was summoned
by His Majesty.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.440
We have to wait a while.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.580
I'll go take a look later.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.640
Alright.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.030
Commander.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.120
The servant said you have been waiting
for me to come home.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.080
Yes.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.120
I came to return this.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.720
Now you won't even accept these?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.880
Commander Pei,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.870
you and I owe each other nothing.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.430
You don't need to feel burdened.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.750
As for this matter,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.630
I need some time.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.240
I think

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.270
we should deal with the matter
at hand first.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.920
The matter about Hongzhen Incense,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.680
we must not allow this thing
to continue harming the people.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.020
The rumors about the Prince
were spread by me.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.190
His Majesty summoned you to the palace
for this matter as well, right?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.070
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.750
As long as it's you who did it,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.190
then it's not trouble.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.750
Besides, you actually helped me a lot.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.040
However, Feng Zhengxin will definitely
not let this go.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.070
What do you plan to do next?

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.950
Just wait.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.390
He will come looking for me.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.720
Look at what you've done.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.750
Who allowed you to let Cui Yunfeng go

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.000
to deal with Xu Wanning?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.390
I just can't stand her.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.560
I want her to be utterly disgraced.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.040
Now she is fine.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.870
But I am about to be utterly disgraced.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.110
Father,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.360
are those rumors outside true?

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.910
What?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.070
You believe them too?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.430
It's just...

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.830
It's just that gossip is terrifying.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.390
Xu Wanning is dealing with us
in this way right now.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.840
Father,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.630
we must quickly come up with a solution.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.560
Your Highness, bad news!

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.000
His Majesty suddenly issued an order

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.290
to investigate all the officials.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.450
Even our mansion will be guarded
by the Jinlin Guards.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.200
If that's the case,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.920
I'm afraid we will be under control.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.270
His Majesty must have believed
those rumors.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.750
This Xu Wanning

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.800
is truly not simple.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.920
Since it has come to this point,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.630
then we shall find a way
to get rid of her.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.520
Yes.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.140
(Commander's Mansion)

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.070
My Lady, there is a letter for you.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.870
It has indeed arrived.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.910
Hongmei,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.920
get ready. We're going out.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.100
My Lady, the Commander
is investigating cases outside.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.600
Should we wait for him to come back...

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.150
No need.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.790
If so, it might be too late.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.030
Let's go first.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.000
- Alright.
- Let's go.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.870
Madam Pei, you're truly impressive.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.360
I once had genuine feelings for you.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.600
Now you show me no mercy at all.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.840
Have you ever shown mercy
to the Xu Family?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.390
If others do not offend me,

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.300
I will not offend them.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.360
Do you need me to explain one by one

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.390
what you have done to my family?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.360
What exactly do you want?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.150
Do you remember this?

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.440
When I was at the Marquis's Mansion,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.360
I already suspected

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.720
why the Marquis dislikes
Cui Yunfeng so much.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.030
I thought he despised Cui Yunfeng
for being mediocre and incompetent.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.150
Later, I found this on Cui Yunfeng.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.550
Then I understood the reason behind it.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.510
What are you trying to say?

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.000
You and Lady Cui are old acquaintances.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.630
You met when you were young

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.900
and you loved her at first sight.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.840
This is your token of love.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.790
But in the end,
you chose power and influence

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.460
and married the Princess's mother.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.750
Lady Cui, in a fit of anger,
married into the Cui Family.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.240
Who told you all these things?

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.310
No matter when, such matters

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.250
will always be talked about
with great interest.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.480
I can find out just by asking.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.030
But you probably don't know

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.390
when Lady Cui married
into the Cui Family,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.790
she was already pregnant.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.080
Therefore,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.360
Cui Yunfeng is your son, right?

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.720
All of this is nothing more
than your speculation.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.200
If it is only speculation,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.910
the rumors will naturally disappear.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.990
Your Highness, what are you afraid of?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.630
You came to see me today.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.990
Isn't it because you fear
this matter will be confirmed?

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.720
Where is Cui Yunfeng?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.560
What?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.960
Have you started to care
about your own son?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.630
Or

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.200
are you in a hurry to find him
and silence him?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.240
What do you mean?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.080
Even if there was youthful affection,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.240
Lady Cui

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.670
was nothing more
than a pawn in your career.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.500
Before Lady Cui passed away,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.300
she only told you
about Cui Yunfeng's matter,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.360
hoping you would save him.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.710
But for the sake of your career
and reputation,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.030
you ignored him completely.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.510
But in the end,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.600
Cui Yunfeng was rescued by the Princess.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.670
Your Highness, don't be angry.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.120
I can give you Cui Yunfeng.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.910
But I need you
to trade something for it.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.200
What do you want?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.630
All of our family's property
that you took away.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.120
Madam Pei, you're truly not simple.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.600
Then this deal,

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.200
are you going to do it or not?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.240
You know I originally didn't
want Cui Yunfeng to live.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.240
What if I don't save him?

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.910
Then your career and future

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.240
would be even more worrying.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.320
Some time ago, because of the rumors,

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.170
it must have given you
quite a headache, right?

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.870
If an illegitimate child appears...

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.670
This is all the property
of the Xu Family.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.840
Where is Cui Yunfeng?

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.110
Hongmei.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.440
Your Highness, rest assured.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440
He is doing well.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.240
I won't disturb your reunion.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.540
I shall take my leave first.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.820
- Go.
- Yes.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.280
Hongmei,

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.550
I think Feng Zhengxin is unlikely

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.750
to let us go so easily.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.770
Take this with you.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.440
Hurry to the Xu Family.
I'll go that way.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.110
My Lady.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.840
There's not much time left, hurry.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.080
What if you're in danger?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.870
Don't worry. Someone will come
to save me.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.750
Quick, quick!

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.390
Your Highness.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.480
Xu Wanning,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.480
you pride yourself on being clever.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.750
Don't you understand

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.510
no matter what,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.670
you are doomed?

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.270
It seems you never intend

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.080
to let me return alive today.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.510
Xu Wanning,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.750
you let him inhale Hongzhen Incense?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.660
Your Highness, you misunderstood me.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.360
It was he who lacked self-control

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.800
and got addicted to Hongzhen Incense.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.930
It has nothing to do with me.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.750
Your Highness, if you feel sorry
for your son,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.150
then give him some.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.870
What did you say? Son?

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.120
Your Highness, you still don't know.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.840
Cui Yunfeng is your biological brother,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.550
the Prince's biological son.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.590
Father,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.870
didn't you say those rumors
were all false?

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.750
Xiaoxiao,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.910
I'll explain some things
to you clearly later.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320
I see.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.150
You have been cold and distant

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.440
toward my mother.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.900
It's all because in your heart,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.510
it's always been Cui Yunfeng's mother.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.920
Xiaoxiao,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.990
I will definitely make it up to you
in the future.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.150
Make it up? How will you make it up?

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.200
Can you bring my mother back to life?

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.390
Now

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.790
the culprit behind the rumors
is still here.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.750
The top priority is to deal
with Xu Wanning first.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.750
Your Highness,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.840
how can you bear to do this?

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.480
It seems the Princess is also going
to become a pawn in your career.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.040
Your Highness,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.030
he is trying to pin all the killing
on you.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.030
Even so,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.790
I must kill you first.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.720
Most of the Prince's Hongzhen Incense
has been sealed off.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.560
I just didn't expect

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.720
a large amount of his silver
has been used for training troops.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.670
I will report to the Emperor.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.200
Send someone to keep watch.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.720
Once any anomaly is found,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.100
take them down in one move.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.230
Yes.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.480
We enter the palace now?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.390
Let's go home first.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.960
If it weren't for you,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.360
things wouldn't have developed
to this point today.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.600
Give me incense! Incense!

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.670
Feng!

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.440
(I didn't expect to be saved by him.)

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.630
Feng...

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.870
Xiaoxiao, kill this woman for me.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.630
Xu Wanning,

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.670
I have always treated you
as a good friend.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.720
But you hurt me again and again.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.590
So

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.790
even if I kill you today,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.510
it would be to avenge myself.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.790
It's not that I am harming you.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.030
It is you who forced yourself
onto this path.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.240
You forced me.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.720
Six years ago at the poetry gathering,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.320
you committed a disgraceful act

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.720
at my birthday banquet.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.720
It also implicated me.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.630
From that time on,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.720
Heng gradually distanced himself
from me.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.960
I've been waiting.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.910
I just wanted to spend more time
with Heng.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.320
But why

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.480
is it that after six years,
the one he likes is you?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.670
Why does he want to marry you,
but not me?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.550
So your resentment toward me

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.630
is all because of him.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.590
Yes.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.470
So

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.910
I have already killed someone.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.270
I don't care to kill one more of you.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.790
If you are dead,

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.670
how could Heng still like you?

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.110
How is it? Are you hurt?

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.830
I'm fine. Did you see the mark
I left for you?

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.630
I came late.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.320
Feng Xiaoxiao,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.480
do you really think I wouldn't kill you?

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.390
Commander Pei,

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.160
if you want to kill my daughter,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.030
you must first get my consent.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.560
Your Highness,

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.160
even if I kill you right now,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.680
His Majesty would not object.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.070
Are you threatening me?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.550
You know clearly what you have done.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.880
His Majesty is now aware

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.070
of your private stockpiling of troops.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.590
Awesome, Commander Pei.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.400
You found out so quickly.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.110
It seems now I really can't
let you live.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.300
Whether I can live or not,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.070
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.960
If the two of us can leave here today,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.030
then you still have a way to live.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680
If not,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.030
then you have no way out but death.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.200
Get out!

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.480
Father, I beg you.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.000
Please let them go.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.680
Don't kill him.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.070
Drink it while it's hot.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.790
Commander, bad news! The Prince is dead.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.080
