=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.780
=Episode 5=

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.399
What did you tell me?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.071
You told me it was a business trip,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.448
and now I see you went on holiday
with another man!

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:29.960
If that's not cheating, what is it?

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:31.679
Stop calling me already!

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.279
I'm busy with work.

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:34.360
Stop clinging to me!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.640
Let's at least leave
something good between us, all right?

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.279
Huh? All right?

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:39.240
Stop calling me!

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160
So, she cheated.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.759
Not a big deal.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.360
Patient No. 49, Shen Mingzhu,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.240
please proceed
to consultation room No. 8.

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.919
You...

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.520
Hello.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.800
What are you here for?

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:28.559
I'm nine weeks pregnant.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.040
Things have been rough at home lately.

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.119
My sleep's a mess,

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:34.520
and I've been in a poor mood.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.040
I'm worried it might affect the baby,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.279
so I came for a check-up.

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.599
That's due to hormones.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320
It's normal for pregnant women
to have mood swings.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:44.760
It's a cornual pregnancy.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.999
Is that serious?

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:49.204
Yours is on the left front side,
so it's not too bad.

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:50.760
Try lying more on your right side,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.671
and see if it helps the baby
move into position.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.119
But you need close follow-ups.

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.360
And if it doesn't develop properly?

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.200
Then the baby might not make it.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.560
You'd need to have an abortion

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:04.693
as soon as possible.

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.760
I'm just giving you
the worst-case scenario,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760
so don't worry too much.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.640
A mother's good mood matters most.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.080
I'll prescribe you some folic acid.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.520
Come back in two weeks.

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.182
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:24.640
We'd like to interview Shen Mingzhu.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.190
A hospital is not your place
for interviews!

00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:27.329
It's a legitimate interview.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.590
Shen Mingzhu, is your baby healthy?

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.200
May I ask if you're under any pressure
or facing difficulties right now?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.426
Security, get them out of here!

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:33.560
The doctor hit someone!

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.480
Let go of me!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.520
You're

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.119
a parent now too.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.559
How do you feel about the parents
who abandoned you back then?

00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:41.760
What are you doing?
I'll expose you!

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.839
- The doctor hit someone!
- Let's go!

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.200
I'll expose you!

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.640
I'll expose you!

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.760
We...

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.271
We have the right to interview!

00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:50.140
Security,
don't let these people in ever again!

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.760
Are you all right?

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.839
I'm fine.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.960
Thank you, Dr. Li.

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.599
I needed an outlet.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.320
Hard times will pass.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.140
(The causes of a cornual pregnancy...)

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.919
Mingzhu.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.239
Mrs. Feng.

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.080
Have you decided whether

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.960
to keep the baby?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.479
Not yet.

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:06.080
The doctor said
it's a cornual pregnancy.

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:08.848
We'll have to wait for the next check-up

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:11.080
to know if the baby's here to stay.

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:12.320
It'll be fine.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.239
The baby will be fine.

00:05:14.337 --> 00:05:15.982
We've got strong genes in our family.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.520
Jianqi was a healthy boy,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.200
and he was even a swimming champion.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.880
Mingzhu,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.159
this is Jianqi's phone.

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.839
You should keep it.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.799
Thank you, Mrs. Feng.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.000
Call "Mother".

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.719
You should call me "Mother" now.

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.799
Go on.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.919
I'm sorry. I have to go.

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:53.080
When you said you
write everything yourselves,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080
I didn't believe it.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.220
Didn't expect you to come
for the interview in person.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.599
You need to go beneath the surface

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.560
to find something worth writing about.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.880
Must be hard writing all those articles.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.640
Yes.

00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:07.710
Our team often
has brainstorming sessions

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:09.399
till past midnight.

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.919
You need a good angle.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.479
You can't just follow the crowd.

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:14.880
Those viral pieces

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.640
explode like a volcano.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.640
Without long nights

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:20.080
and blood and sweat as fuel,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.640
you couldn't possibly pull that off.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.719
Impressive team you have.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.599
Looks like Rufeng Liquor
picked the right partners.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.440
Since you're here

00:06:28.448 --> 00:06:30.689
for the interview,
have a taste of our liquor first.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.782
Li Bai's inspiration flowed best
with liquor in hand.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.960
Our article should be steeped

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.200
in the aroma of liquor, too.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.560
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.120
Zhixia's pregnant.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.760
Really?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.839
Congratulations!

00:06:39.937 --> 00:06:40.720
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.440
I'll most definitely choose Rufeng
for the baby's one-month celebration.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.560
Excellent choice.

00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:46.390
Then, just have half a cup today.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.880
Better not.

00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:50.320
What's there to be afraid of?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.360
My mother drank plenty
when she was expecting me.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.760
And look at me.
I even opened a distillery.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.719
Is that true, Mr. Lu?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.039
That's quite the gift.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.382
If you really can't drink,

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:03.440
I won't push.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.000
Drinking's like writing, after all.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It takes talent.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.080
No, Mr. Lu.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.279
We must have

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.560
the liquor.

00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:13.320
Maybe I'll end up raising
a future owner of a distillery, too.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.960
Right, Maodou?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.719
All right, then.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.093
You tell me when to stop.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.960
Don't.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.120
Fill it up.

00:07:19.382 --> 00:07:20.826
Rufeng Liquor only tastes right full.

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:22.359
Good.

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:26.359
Zhixia.

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:27.520
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:31.000
Zhixia...

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.960
Here, Maodou.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.279
Thank you.

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:34.279
How is it?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.719
Maodou,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.000
let's toast Mr. Lu

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.399
with his liquor,

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.760
and borrow a bit of his brilliance.

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:42.560
Cheers.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.520
You're too kind...

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.382
Bottoms up.

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:55.039
This liquor...

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.640
It's mellow with a rich aftertaste.

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.640
It goes down smoothly.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.604
This is good stuff.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.640
Zhixia, you know your liquor.

00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:07.910
That's a spot-on review.

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:08.359
Really?

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:09.159
Absolutely.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:10.960
Once the bottle was opened,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.560
the aroma filled the air.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.560
If I weren't pregnant,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.799
I'd definitely have another.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.719
There'll be plenty of chances.

00:08:19.537 --> 00:08:20.880
Then, I'll count on your help

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.560
with the promotion.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.320
We won't disappoint you.

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:25.560
Zhixia,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.919
I'm so impressed by you.

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.389
Mr. Lu nearly forgot
his own name back there.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.648
He thought he was some kind
of liquor deity come to earth.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.399
That's what I call social experience.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:35.960
Maodou,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.479
you stick with me and learn well.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.760
Don't even think about job-hopping.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.519
In big companies,

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.040
you're just a cog in the machine.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320
Here,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.400
you could be my right hand.

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:48.719
Zhixia.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.349
You're so capable.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.871
What's making you hesitate
about having a second child?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.359
If a better opportunity comes up,

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:58.239
you should take it.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:08:59.440
Don't stay with me.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.359
Where are you going?

00:09:00.359 --> 00:09:01.599
Changhong Road.

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:02.829
What for?

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.515
To buy paper offerings. It's my maternal
grandmother's 21th-day memorial.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.599
Zhidong.

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:10.200
Zhixia. Hao.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.760
What are you doing standing there?

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:13.800
Waiting for you.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:16.160
Better not bring those things inside.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.239
Why not?

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:19.560
Dad blames our grandmother

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:20.920
for sending our sister away,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.737
so he's banned us
from visiting her grave.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.080
And then?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.160
Mom told me to talk to Uncle

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.982
and the others.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.800
The group chat will go silent,
only private messages,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.004
and we'll meet separately.

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:31.639
Is this a spy movie or something?

00:09:31.693 --> 00:09:32.750
Call it whatever you like,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.093
as long as it keeps the peace.

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:36.479
Is all that really necessary? Relax.

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:37.239
Dad.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400
Zhang Hao, you're here.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.960
Dad.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.280
Come on. Get inside.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.119
Big brother?

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:48.680
We'll head out tomorrow morning
at 7:30 AM sharp.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.040
When you leave,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.119
give us a heads-up.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.320
Oh, right.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.359
Don't say anything in the group chat.

00:09:57.359 --> 00:09:59.239
Just send me a message.

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:00.470
If anything comes up,

00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:01.999
we'll talk privately.

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:03.560
All right,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.719
so it's settled.

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:06.469
Let's stick with that.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.337
- That's all.
- No need to pretend with us.

00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:10.080
You scared me.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.719
Mom.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:13.350
Zhang Hao, you're here.

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:14.229
Mom.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.404
Who was the man
you were talking to on the phone?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.759
Oh, you...

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:19.920
You never have a kind word, do you?

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.359
It was...

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.440
your uncle.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.680
We can't let your dad know about us

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.080
visiting your grandma's grave.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.599
Otherwise, he'll blow up again.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.359
Even if we don't tell him,
he'll find out.

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:34.160
The whole family's going out together.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.359
Tomorrow. He's going fishing.

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:38.359
You know him. He leaves before dawn

00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:39.920
and doesn't come back till dark.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.960
And what if tomorrow he comes home early

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.320
by chance?

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:44.800
Here's what we'll do.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.080
Have Zhang Hao go fishing with him.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.920
That way, someone can cover for us.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.960
Do we really need
to make such a big deal out of this?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.839
I'll go check the situation first.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.879
Zhang Hao cracks me up.

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:00.320
Xu Zhidong,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.671
you could learn something from him.

00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:03.320
A man

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.440
should carry some authority.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.879
That's what makes women respect you.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.239
She might even be sneaking around
to make calls.

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:10.599
Who says I'm scared?

00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:11.440
I'm not scared.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.759
Not at all.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.320
Why...

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.359
Why should I be afraid

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:17.719
to visit my own mother's grave?

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.759
It's not even against the law, right?

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.119
I...

00:11:20.119 --> 00:11:22.160
Then why are you whispering?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.320
I'm not... Fish!

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.440
My fish.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.599
I need to check on my fish.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.239
Dad,

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:33.239
I heard you're going fishing tomorrow?

00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:35.160
Yes, at the Chu River.

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:36.920
Plenty of wild carp there.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:38.920
Jiao loves fish soup.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.239
I'll bring some back

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:42.080
so your mother can make it for you guys.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.479
Thanks, Dad.

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:49.239
You already know everything, don't you?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.999
Hao,

00:11:55.599 --> 00:11:57.680
do you really think I'd stop your mother

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.440
from visiting the old lady's grave?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.639
True.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.920
I just talk big sometimes.

00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:05.110
When I was away those years,

00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:07.759
it was your grandmother
who raised the two of them.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.519
I did hate her,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.639
but I also owe her.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.320
Right?

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.759
So you're just using fishing

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:16.999
as an excuse

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:19.359
to give them time
to visit her grave, huh?

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.080
You talk too much.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.280
Move aside.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.080
Okay.

00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:26.040
Dinner time. Put your phone down.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.639
Zhidong!

00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:27.200
Zhidong!

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.560
Quick! Help me with this.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.440
Hold that.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.440
The fried fish is
a little overdone today.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:33.560
No,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.040
it's perfect.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.470
You haven't even tasted it yet.

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:37.519
Flatterer.

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:38.560
It smells perfect already.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.800
Mom, tomorrow...

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.400
Can you make
stir-fried turnip greens tomorrow?

00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:53.589
Finish what's in your bowl

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.204
before talking about tomorrow's meal.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.400
Zhang Hao,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.519
did anyone reply
to that missing-person post

00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:01.719
you made online?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.639
A few did,

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:06.400
but I checked them all.

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:07.519
None matched.

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:10.680
Well...

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.400
They've already demolished
the town hospital.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.119
That makes the search even harder.

00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:16.759
Mom.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:18.879
We can't rush this.

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:19.871
Think about it.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.270
It's been nearly thirty years
since our sister was sent away.

00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:23.439
It can't be easy to find her.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.160
Unless...

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.680
Unless what?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.582
Unless our family
was rich or influential.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.359
Listen to him...

00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:31.440
Should've sent him away back then.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.400
All right, enough.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:33.960
Dad.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.160
How about I have a drink with you?

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:37.680
You see?

00:13:37.693 --> 00:13:38.470
- No drinking.
- I'll get the liquor.

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:39.280
You're driving later.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:39.960
Right.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.599
You drive, then.

00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:41.200
No...

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.759
(Couple's watches.)

00:13:49.004 --> 00:13:49.870
(What do you think?)

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.200
(The second hands move in sync.)

00:13:51.204 --> 00:13:53.180
(Every minute, every second,
I'm in step with you.)

00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:54.471
(Every minute, every second,)

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.719
(I love you.)

00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:00.719
Come in.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.040
Mom.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.359
Here you go.

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:11.440
I warmed up some milk.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.359
Okay.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.182
It's not too hot, right?

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:19.320
Not hot.

00:14:22.382 --> 00:14:23.915
Mom, you should go to bed now.

00:14:23.915 --> 00:14:24.804
It's so late.

00:14:24.848 --> 00:14:25.870
Anyway, I can't sleep.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.080
Seeing you makes me feel more at ease.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.519
Did I ever tell you?

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:36.680
It was Xiaoni's Mom.

00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:40.400
When she was pregnant with Xiaoni,
she had a cornual pregnancy,

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:42.800
but it turned out fine.

00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:43.839
It healed on its own.

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.479
Look how smart Xiaoni is now.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.519
It's actually fine.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.080
We don't need to worry.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.879
Drink a bit more.

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:04.200
Zhixia.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.040
This electric car is very good.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.920
It's really fast.

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.560
Just enjoy it,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560
but pedal slowly.

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:11.119
It uses up a lot of battery.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.515
Then don't let me drive it back.

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:14.119
Mom, don't rush.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.639
Send a message to Uncle.

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:17.320
Tell him we're almost there.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.080
I already told him.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.620
I messaged him as soon as I came out,
saying we're almost there.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.239
Mom, you're really a pro driver.

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:23.519
What?

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.119
Nothing.

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:26.239
What's wrong? We're almost there.

00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:28.960
By the way...

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.160
Zhixia.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.080
Pregnant women are more susceptible
to attracting bad things.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.160
The old ring.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.719
The old ring, pure gold.

00:15:38.719 --> 00:15:39.719
Put it on.

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:43.639
Why's it so loose?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.479
If you throw it again...

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:46.800
I'll put it here.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.599
It can ward off evil.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.639
It wards off evil. It's got that power.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.589
I've worked hard for
the Xu family all these years,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.204
caring for the elders and children.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.839
Zhang Hao, did you see?

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.680
Madam Yu finally has a conscience.

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:04.759
Look, Xu Zhidong.

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:06.200
Xu Zhidong.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.080
This ring is actually not too big.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.119
Do you like it?

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.719
Of course I like it.

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:12.920
Who doesn't like gold?

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.759
Thanks, Mom.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:15.920
Wear it for a few more days
and then return it to me.

00:16:16.479 --> 00:16:17.239
You're something.

00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:19.160
What are you laughing at?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.119
This was passed down to me
by your grandmother.

00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:23.510
She said it's passed down to men,
not women.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.200
Zhixia, don't worry.

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.239
Later, Mom will pass it to me.

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:28.560
Then I'll give it to you.

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:30.119
Would Bichen be happy to do it?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.800
For big matters like this,
she listens to me.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:33.960
Right?

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.160
Xu Zhidong, you'd better remember this.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.999
Alright, stop joking.

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:39.960
Hurry up. We're almost there. Go ahead.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.280
Right, turn right!

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.560
Right, just park there.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.160
Your uncle and the rest
are already here.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.960
Hurry up.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.119
We're late.

00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:47.160
Hurry up.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.320
Everyone's here already.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.839
Park quickly.

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:50.639
Alright, slow down.

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:51.400
Don't hesitate.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:51.999
Zhidong.

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:52.879
Quickly open the trunk.

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:54.800
It's not like we're going to work.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.160
Do we need to clock in?

00:16:56.719 --> 00:16:57.479
Nonsense!

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.879
Can your grandmother wait?

00:16:58.879 --> 00:16:59.800
Hurry up.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.759
What's this?

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:02.879
Fried fish for your grandmother.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.359
We're here, everyone.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.040
Hurry up.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.519
Alright, slow down. Don't rush.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.200
Mom, don't worry, okay?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:08.759
Slow down.

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:09.759
The road ahead is rough.

00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:11.200
Brother!

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.879
- Sister!
- Finally here.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.400
- Alright.
- Don't rush.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.559
Slow down.

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:17.239
Slow down. We're not late.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.840
- I'm not late.
- Second Aunt.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.519
Slow down.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:21.039
Alright.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:21.920
Aunt.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.239
Sister.

00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:24.600
You guys are so early.

00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:27.840
Alright.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:29.640
Jingxiang, you...

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.120
Mom.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.680
Jingyun and I already set it up.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.640
You just came and placed it
in the middle.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.319
That's right.

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.759
Mom loves the fried fish
I made the most.

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:37.600
Right, Mom?

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.400
Nonsense.

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:41.360
Mom loves the braised bream
I made the most.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.999
Look, two fish.

00:17:42.999 --> 00:17:45.559
Alright.
You should've bought a bigger one.

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:46.640
You bought such a small one.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.200
Even the cat won't be full.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.440
- Do you understand?
- True.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.680
We need to eat small fish.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.920
The small ones have more flavor.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.880
Our sister is right.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.880
You're just petty.

00:17:56.999 --> 00:17:59.799
Honestly, look at how wide
my fried fish is.

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:00.239
Right?

00:18:00.239 --> 00:18:02.039
We've all eaten the small ones.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.999
As for our cooking skills,

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:05.279
let's have Mom judge.

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:05.920
Mom.

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.840
Which one of us three is the best cook?

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.799
Mom.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.279
If Grandma really came out to judge,

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:11.640
we'd all be scared.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.600
Alright.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.880
If you keep arguing,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.680
you'll wake Mom up.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.400
Come.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.360
Come, everyone, stand up.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.079
Come.

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:19.400
Good, thank you.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.600
This is the taste.

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:23.680
Come, try it.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.999
This is their signature dish.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.400
Mom.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400
You leave it. I'll wash.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:35.999
No.

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:36.999
- Why did you get up?
- I'll wash.

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:37.680
Don't do it.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.600
Didn't the doctor tell you to stay
in bed?

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.120
I'm tired of lying. It's fine.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.759
Go ahead.

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.840
You don't need to.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.840
No, change your position.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.759
You can't get up.

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:47.759
I'm tired, Mom.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.079
It's fine. I'm helping out.

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:49.640
No.

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:52.400
If you want something, just call us.

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:54.440
Mom.

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:55.759
Slow down.

00:18:55.999 --> 00:18:57.160
Give, bow to Grandma.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.479
Mom.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:03.079
Please bless our family.

00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:06.200
May we be free from illness
and disaster.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.279
We don't ask for great wealth,

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:10.999
nor do we ask for riches.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.519
We only ask for peace.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.160
Mom.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:18.999
Second Aunt didn't even ask
for my opinion.

00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:20.120
I just want to be rich.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.999
I just want wealth.

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:22.519
Later, tell Grandma.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.120
Mom, Mom.

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:26.360
Mom.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.559
Mom, slow down.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.319
Mom.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.799
Mom.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.519
Mom, slow down.

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:32.640
Mom.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.759
Mom.

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:36.239
Zhilu still hasn't been found.

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:38.680
I'm almost dying, Mom.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.999
Mom.

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:42.360
It was Grandma who sent the girl away.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.600
Mom.

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:46.479
We've posted on newspapers

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:48.279
and online,

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:50.640
but we still can't find her.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.920
Do you also have her

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.160
in your heart?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.759
Mom, please

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.960
guide us to the right path.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.239
Mom, please.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.719
Zhilu was sent by you.

00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:11.759
You must take responsibility, Mom.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.160
By the way, Mom.

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:16.400
There's a master in Longhu Alley

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.440
who can walk between the realms.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.719
They say he's especially amazing.

00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:22.799
I want him to find you, Mom.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.079
To ask you...

00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:27.759
Where did you send Zhilu to?

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.999
I'm just giving you a heads up, Mom.

00:20:30.999 --> 00:20:32.920
If anyone asks you about this,

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:35.279
please don't be shocked.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:37.160
Don't be scared, Mom.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:37.880
Jingxiang,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.893
is the person you're talking about
called Zhang Dongmao?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.239
Yes.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.200
He's a scammer. He got arrested.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.519
Really. I'm not lying.

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:49.640
He got arrested?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.239
Mom.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.680
He got arrested.

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:55.600
Where can I find Zhilu?

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.479
Mom, it's okay.

00:20:56.479 --> 00:20:57.440
I'm here.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.120
Get up.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.160
I'll go find my sister.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.880
I'll go find her.

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:02.880
Mrs. Feng.

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:03.680
Where's Mingzhu?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.719
Upstairs.

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:05.360
Okay.

00:21:09.893 --> 00:21:11.440
(We want to interview the hero's wife.)

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:13.799
This was taken of me in the hospital
the other day.

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.880
It has over 100,000 views.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:17.920
This is an invasion of privacy!

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.920
How could this happen?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.715
(Now you're a parent too.)

00:21:19.715 --> 00:21:20.960
(How do you feel about
your parents abandoning you?)

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.920
Come on, I'll help you file a complaint.

00:21:23.239 --> 00:21:25.360
These marketing accounts
are really too much.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.079
Zhilu.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:31.999
Zhilu.

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:35.120
Where can I find Zhilu?

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.640
You said they took the child away
as soon as she was born.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.999
I never saw the child.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.680
I never even touched her.

00:21:45.893 --> 00:21:46.600
(I want to ask...)

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.079
She was just taken away.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.840
After all these years...

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.319
(What do you think about it?)

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:52.160
(Call security.)

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:54.559
Isn't this a coincidence?

00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:55.999
Look.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.799
This girl was also adopted.

00:21:58.239 --> 00:22:00.239
Look, her age is about the same.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.799
Wait...

00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:08.999
Son.

00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:09.999
Son, come here.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:11.960
Come, turn your face this way.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320
This...

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.582
Let me see.

00:22:17.582 --> 00:22:18.750
Let me see her information.

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:19.519
Mom.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.840
I want to see her.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.920
Quick, get her.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.680
Let me see her.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.999
That one.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.319
Quick.

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:26.999
Here, found her.

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:28.200
Right.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.900
(March 26th, Happy Birthday to me)

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.999
This is too much of a coincidence.

00:22:36.239 --> 00:22:38.239
She was also born on March 26th.

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:48.039
(Happy Birthday to you.)

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.999
(Happy Birthday to you.)

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.880
Mom has shown her spirit!

00:22:55.804 --> 00:22:57.026
Mom has shown her spirit!

00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.070
She has shown her spirit!

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:00.239
Mom has shown her spirit!

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.840
Mom has shown her spirit!

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:04.549
(Shen Mingzhu, is the child healthy?)

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.550
(Do you have any difficulties
or pressures right now?)

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:07.440
(No. Don't pull me.)

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.799
(We're doing a serious interview.)

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:09.920
(I want to ask...)

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:15.559
(Shen Mingzhu, is the child healthy?)

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.630
(Do you have any difficulties
or pressures right now?)

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.479
(No. Don't pull me!)

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:19.840
(We're doing a serious interview.)

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.920
(I want to ask...)

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:22.319
(Now you are a parent too.)

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:23.680
(How do you feel about your parents)

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.279
(abandoning you?)

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.079
(Call security.)

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:26.960
(Do an interview.)

00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:28.799
(Don't touch me!)

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:30.180
♪A long letter written♪

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.060
♪Letting love gently expand♪

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.559
What is this?

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:38.160
What's going on?

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.039
(Doing an interview.)

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.519
(The doctor hit someone!)

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.239
(Don't touch me!)

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:00.600
(Shen Family Restaurant)
Go ahead, tell me.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.559
What were you thinking?

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.039
Feng Jianqi is a hero.

00:24:03.115 --> 00:24:03.640
Stop filming.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.999
He is the bloodline of heroes.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.759
Stop filming!

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:09.440
He is the posthumous son.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.840
He just passed away.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.248
And now you don't want this child?

00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:15.029
What is this? This is too much.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.760
Shen Mingzhu,
what are you really thinking?

00:24:16.782 --> 00:24:17.600
Stop filming!

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.719
Stop filming.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:19.999
Move away.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.709
Stop filming! What do you want?

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.537
Everyone, get up!

00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:25.550
Get lost.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.759
I'll kill you!

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:29.559
You're still hitting me?

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.600
Is this still the family of a hero?

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:34.519
Don't hit me!

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:36.440
Give it to me!

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:38.999
Dad!

00:24:39.239 --> 00:24:40.120
- Dad, move!
- Go!

00:24:40.239 --> 00:24:41.039
Go, you go.

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.600
Get lost! Everyone, get lost!

00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:44.230
If you come again,
I'll pour water on you.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.404
What kind of manners is this?

00:24:45.426 --> 00:24:47.070
Stop filming!

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.120
Go away!

00:24:48.479 --> 00:24:50.640
Stop filming! Everyone, get lost!

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.519
Get lost!

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.999
Who lacks manners now?

00:24:52.999 --> 00:24:54.799
If you dare come and film again, try me!

00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:56.719
Don't let me see you again!

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.840
- Get lost! Go away!
- This is too much!

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.093
- Stop filming!
- You can't bully people like this.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.600
You've brought this to my doorstep.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.079
It's okay.

00:25:04.719 --> 00:25:06.079
Your brother can handle it there.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.400
It'll be fine soon.

00:25:08.137 --> 00:25:09.070
Sit down for a while.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.440
Hey.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.279
Feng and his wife are here.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.440
Mingzhu.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.279
Quick, come in.

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.200
Are you okay?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.559
Why are you guys here?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.799
It's like this.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.400
We saw the video.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.648
Feng said something
was definitely going to happen,

00:25:27.671 --> 00:25:28.648
so we hurried over.

00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:31.360
We didn't expect it to turn out
like this.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.120
Exactly.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.239
You know, online bullying

00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:34.319
is terrifying.

00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:36.759
My daughter's already
been through a lot.

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:37.400
You know.

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:38.640
In-laws.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.120
Let's not talk too much.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.915
Here is the thing.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.880
We want to bring Mingzhu home
to stay for a few days.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.360
This online bullying

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.680
comes fast and goes fast.

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:50.079
Calm down.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:51.319
It'll be fine in a few days.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.200
What did you say you were going
to do? I didn't hear clearly.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.239
Well.

00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:59.880
We want to bring Mingzhu home
to stay for a few days.

00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:01.519
To your place?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.200
Is that okay?

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.440
Mingzhu, what do you think?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.319
Alright.

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:12.120
Okay.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.960
Then...

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:15.799
Stay for two days, and then come back.

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:16.479
Okay.

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:17.960
Then, um...

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.160
Let's go the back way.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.479
- Okay.
- OK.

00:26:21.319 --> 00:26:21.920
Quick.

00:26:24.804 --> 00:26:27.026
I've been talking to you,
and you weren't listening.

00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:28.120
It worked.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.519
Yeah.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.448
My parents were so excited
that they didn't sleep all night.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.960
The two of them

00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:35.799
were almost at each other's throats.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.160
But overnight, they formed
a united front.

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:39.840
They both agreed that Shen Mingzhu

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.079
is the little girl we sent away.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.200
Then?

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.640
Then they sent me with Xu Zhidong

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.559
to find her.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.160
You know that, right?

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.600
Sending me with Xu Zhidong

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.799
is basically sending me alone.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.680
I'm here with you too.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.519
Didn't you say I'm a part of your life?

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.920
Yes, I said that.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.640
Besides,

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.840
Xu Zhidong might not even want
to find her.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.999
Think about it.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.719
He's the youngest in the Xu family.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.840
Since childhood,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.120
all the good stuff at home goes
to him first.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.759
Now suddenly, an older sister drops
from the sky.

00:27:14.239 --> 00:27:16.120
Well, he's going to lose favor.

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:18.680
Zhang Hao.

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.400
Adults still fight for favor?

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.719
I've noticed you get sleepy
really easily.

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:24.559
Do you want to go to the hospital
to check?

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:25.319
Check what?

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.640
Your blood might be thick.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.759
I'm worried.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.719
Quick, it's okay.

00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:31.719
Quick, come.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.039
This way.

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:37.440
Mingzhu.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.039
Call us anytime if there's anything.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.160
If you want anything to eat, just say.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.382
Your dad will bring it over.

00:27:43.404 --> 00:27:44.510
I will cook for you.

00:27:44.582 --> 00:27:46.782
If you're uncomfortable staying here,
just tell us.

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:48.239
Don't worry.

00:27:48.239 --> 00:27:49.640
We'll take good care of her.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.200
Don't worry.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.740
Quick.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.479
I'm leaving.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.239
Go ahead.

00:27:55.319 --> 00:27:55.960
Come on.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.719
Drive slowly.

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:15.759
Hello, everyone.

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:17.239
Right now, we are at

00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:18.519
the door of Shen Mingzhu's house.

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.559
She hasn't come out yet.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.680
We'll wait here.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.400
Wait a moment, everyone.

00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:26.640
Hello, is this Shen Family Restaurant?

00:28:26.782 --> 00:28:27.804
Yes, it's right there.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.360
Right here.

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:33.319
Is anyone here?

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:34.799
Excuse me?

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.880
What are you kids doing here?

00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:39.319
Get in the car first.

00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:40.279
What's going on?

00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:43.079
Why are you filming?

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.680
If you dare come again,

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.840
I'll let you get drenched
in heavy rain.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.319
Don't run!

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.880
Stop filming!

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.559
Follow me anytime.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.440
Going to find her is life-threatening.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.360
At least three lives are at risk
with the two of us.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.239
Go home. Let's not do this.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.640
Zhixia.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.880
Do you smell that?

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.079
Is it just water
inside the kid's water gun? Smell it.

00:29:11.719 --> 00:29:12.600
It's really pungent.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.440
Smell it.

00:29:13.604 --> 00:29:14.830
- Is it?
- What's that smell?

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:16.079
What's in the water gun?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.840
Open the window.

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:20.759
Did you turn on the seat heater?

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.680
No.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:24.640
Really.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.400
Mom.

00:29:28.759 --> 00:29:30.799
Zhilu has been found.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.519
Now Zhixia will go
and inquire a bit more.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.279
Please, show your spirit.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.600
Bless Zhixia.

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:43.519
Bring Zhilu back.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.799
Mom, please show your spirit.

00:29:47.048 --> 00:29:48.048
What are you doing?

00:29:48.048 --> 00:29:48.470
Mom.

00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:49.120
Again.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.200
What? Again?

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.559
Come on.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.880
Mingzhu.

00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:04.039
Meiqi, pour Mingzhu a glass of water.

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:08.799
I've had the room cleaned
by the housekeeper.

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.160
The sheets have been changed too.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:14.920
Mingzhu,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.960
rest well.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.749
We're just across the way.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.093
Call me if you need anything.

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:24.759
Mingzhu,

00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:26.680
give me your phone.

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:32.759
It keeps ringing.

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:34.120
You won't be able to rest.

00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:44.120
Alright, let's go.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.799
Meiqi,

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:46.479
stay with Mingzhu.

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:55.160
Drink some water, Mingzhu.

00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:57.200
Thanks.

00:31:01.719 --> 00:31:03.640
Go inside and rest for a while.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.840
My brother used to say

00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:33.640
this spot needs a photo hung.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.200
I found

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.079
this group photo on his Moments.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.840
I printed it and hung it up.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.519
Later, our wedding photo

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.079
can hang on this wall.

00:32:21.079 --> 00:32:22.160
Then, when I lie down,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.469
I can see the photo.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.271
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:08.799
Go to the back.

00:33:09.671 --> 00:33:10.937
I didn't lock the car.

00:33:10.937 --> 00:33:12.448
You can get in once you pull the door.

00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:13.160
Okay.

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:19.559
Take it slow.

00:33:25.582 --> 00:33:27.715
You won't grow taller holding
an umbrella indoors.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.999
It was raining just now.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:30.999
Slow down.

00:33:30.999 --> 00:33:32.680
Raining? What rain?

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.293
Did you always hold
an umbrella indoors as a kid?

00:33:35.315 --> 00:33:36.382
Give me a break.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.340
(Award)
(Shen Mingzhu)

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.440
You two.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.999
Ma'am.

00:34:14.204 --> 00:34:15.310
What would you like to eat?

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:16.239
Is there food?

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.479
Of course, how can a restaurant
have no food?

00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:19.639
Right, we're here to eat.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:20.840
Okay.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.639
What would you like to order?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.479
You're so annoying.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.559
What's good to eat?

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:29.720
Braised pork chop,
and Shen family smoked fish.

00:34:30.479 --> 00:34:31.720
Add a special fish soup.

00:34:31.782 --> 00:34:33.204
The young man knows what to order.

00:34:33.226 --> 00:34:34.190
All our specialties.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.915
(Shen Family Smoked Fish)
Did my homework first.

00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:39.159
What else would you like?

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:41.199
We'll take a look first.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.079
Take a look.

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:44.519
We'll take a look.

00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:45.360
Okay.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.039
Um...

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.639
Decide and let me know.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.159
Alright.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.800
One braised pork chop.

00:34:57.999 --> 00:34:58.599
And one

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.559
smoked fish.

00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:01.199
Also, a fish soup.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:01.960
Zhang Hao,

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:04.320
look in the direction of seven o'clock.

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:05.360
Awards, huh?

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:06.559
The whole wall is

00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:07.920
all Shen Mingzhu's.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.999
I'm right here watching.

00:35:08.999 --> 00:35:10.639
And the direction of six o'clock.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.519
What's that?

00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:13.320
A piano.

00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:14.199
Really?

00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:14.720
Yes.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:16.320
Wow.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.679
Also Shen Mingzhu's.

00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:22.519
This couple treats her really well.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.119
Seems like it.

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.519
These two

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:27.840
seem like good people.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.039
Stop staring over there.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.440
That one, I just...

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.720
No yogurt?

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:38.599
No yogurt.

00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:40.920
Restaurants usually don't sell yogurt.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.840
You can go next door.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.400
Check the little shop next door.

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:46.159
Okay, thanks.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.119
Where are you going?

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:48.840
To inquire a bit.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.440
Alright.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.960
She's pregnant, craving sour stuff.

00:35:57.079 --> 00:35:57.880
This umbrella's good.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.670
Look at this one.

00:35:58.671 --> 00:35:59.670
Ma'am, any yogurt?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.360
In the fridge. Check it yourself.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.199
The internet is really advanced now.

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:06.920
This morning, the Shen family
restaurant was surrounded.

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:08.599
That's right.

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.440
So many people are taking photos.

00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:13.189
The son of the Shen family
ran the water tap around,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.426
and then it dispersed everyone.

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:15.199
How much?

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.960
Twenty-five eighty yuan.

00:36:17.204 --> 00:36:18.070
I already scanned it.

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:18.840
Alright.

00:36:19.226 --> 00:36:20.248
- Bye.
- See you again.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.679
Miss,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.440
want this camel milk powder?

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:30.440
This is authentic.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.720
We are the exclusive distributor.

00:36:33.639 --> 00:36:34.479
How much?

00:36:34.479 --> 00:36:35.599
One ninety-eight yuan.

00:36:36.999 --> 00:36:37.920
Not cheap.

00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:40.079
Good stuff, right?

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:42.039
No additives at all.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.639
Then I'll take two cans.

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:47.880
Alright.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.039
I'll pack them for you.

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:55.039
Is the daughter of the Shen family
restaurant next door

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.599
not their biological child?

00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:58.199
You know that?

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:01.079
The boss said it himself.

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.119
Shen Shengli said it himself?

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:06.679
Well, it's not a secret.

00:37:06.679 --> 00:37:08.479
Everyone around here knows.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.679
I tell you,

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.119
back then, in Yujia Village,

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.880
there was a village hospital.

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.840
A family had twins,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.960
but couldn't afford both.

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:19.469
The boy was kept,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.182
and the girl was sent
to the Shen family.

00:37:24.199 --> 00:37:26.920
That family really was harsh.

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:28.639
Not really fair to say that.

00:37:28.639 --> 00:37:30.920
They sent her because
the Shen family was good.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.159
After all these years,

00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:35.400
the old Shen couple
treats their daughter

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.999
even better than their biological son.

00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:38.720
When Mingzhu learned piano as a kid,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.360
they spared no expense.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.880
Minghui wanted a basketball,

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.119
but they didn't agree.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.039
That...

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:47.920
This girl's life is pretty good.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.199
Very good.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.039
Not really.

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:52.119
Her husband's dead.

00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:55.999
Check out other things.

00:37:56.479 --> 00:37:57.039
No need.

00:37:57.039 --> 00:37:58.440
How much is it in total?

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.639
Alright, let me calculate.

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:00.360
Two boxes.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.800
Total 396 yuan.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.519
What's going on?
The kid's still not back.

00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:09.400
Stay calm.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.360
Zhixia is back.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.382
Zhixia, how's it going?

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.320
What happened?

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.199
Yes, yes.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.599
First, pay for the milk powder.

00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:21.599
Three ninety-six yuan.

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.679
Round up to 400 yuan.

00:38:22.804 --> 00:38:23.550
Five hundred yuan.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.440
Okay, 500 yuan.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.320
I'll transfer five hundred yuan
to you shortly.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.639
You're starting to extort.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.493
Mom and Dad are so easy
to deal with now.

00:38:29.493 --> 00:38:30.648
Then why don't you do it?

00:38:30.671 --> 00:38:31.790
I don't have startup capital.

00:38:31.804 --> 00:38:32.999
Go away. Stop talking.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.519
Zhixia.

00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:35.079
Yes.

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:36.440
Have you met her in person?

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.079
Yes.

00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:39.880
Not the real person yet.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.960
But I met her parents.

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:43.479
The couple was quite polite.

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:45.159
They run a small restaurant.

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:45.999
Business is good.

00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:47.559
Mostly serving locals.

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:48.159
Right.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:51.079
Zhilu is my daughter.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.559
I am her biological mother.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.320
No way.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.679
I have to go fetch
my biological daughter.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.479
Mom,

00:38:57.479 --> 00:38:59.199
think carefully.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.559
The Shen family raised this girl.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.880
Shen Mingzhu never planned
to acknowledge her real parents.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.720
Now her parents suddenly appear.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.079
Can she handle it?

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:08.469
Besides, she's living well.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:09.982
Why would she need to acknowledge you?

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:10.960
This...

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.119
What are you saying?

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:14.320
We are her biological parents.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:14.679
Yes.

00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:16.519
Breaking bones affects the tendons too.

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:18.519
This isn't up to her.

00:39:18.519 --> 00:39:20.119
The people who sent the girl away

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:22.440
were us, right?

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:22.960
Yes...

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.639
The Shen family raised her with care,

00:39:24.639 --> 00:39:25.880
and did a good job.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.559
She grew up well.

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:27.960
The family was happy together.

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:30.559
Now we want to claim her?

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.960
Even robbers wouldn't do this.

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:34.199
Zhixia.

00:39:34.559 --> 00:39:35.639
I have a question.

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:39.199
How can we prove
that our biological parents

00:39:39.199 --> 00:39:40.999
are Shen Mingzhu's biological parents?

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.840
What nonsense is that?

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.199
Location and time of giving the child,

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:48.199
child's birth date,

00:39:48.199 --> 00:39:49.199
all match.

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:50.880
Looks match too.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.400
But no solid proof.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.720
No solid...

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.360
Wait.

00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:56.720
Zhixia.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.599
Call that little girl out.

00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:01.039
A paternity test will settle it.

00:40:01.039 --> 00:40:02.639
Once tested, we'll know.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.199
Paternity test, good idea.

00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:04.720
Right?

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.920
Great idea.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.479
The problem is, why would

00:40:07.479 --> 00:40:09.679
Shen Mingzhu take a paternity test
with you?

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:11.999
She'd be nice not to hate you.

00:40:11.999 --> 00:40:12.710
- No.
- Go away.

00:40:12.715 --> 00:40:13.630
We have no choice.

00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:15.840
This is all because of the old lady.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.159
No choice?

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:18.440
How can you blame my mom?

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.559
You say it's not her fault?

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:20.240
Whose fault then?

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.079
Yours.

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:22.549
I'm in prison.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.004
Yes, because you're in prison,

00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:25.190
the child couldn't survive.

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:27.440
Stop! All you do is argue!

00:40:29.199 --> 00:40:31.119
Why didn't you give me away back then?

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:32.360
You were a bit older.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.159
Then you should have been given away.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.639
No one should stop me.

00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:37.679
I'm going to fetch my daughter.

00:40:37.679 --> 00:40:39.119
If you go now,

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:40.199
my plan

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:41.720
will be useless.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.039
Zhixia.

00:40:49.199 --> 00:40:50.039
Come.

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:51.119
Yes, Zhixia.

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:53.320
Hurry, sit down.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:54.360
Come, come.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.159
Zhixia.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.519
From now on, Mom and Dad won't argue.

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:01.519
Won't argue.

00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:02.599
We'll listen to you.

00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:03.880
Yes, we'll listen to you.

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:07.840
Zhixia.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.720
Got any good ideas?

00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:11.960
Tell Mom and Dad.

00:41:17.693 --> 00:41:18.630
Didn't Shen Mingzhu

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:20.880
have her prenatal checkups
at the People's Hospital?

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.199
I originally planned to give birth
at the Maternal and Child Hospital.

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:28.599
Now I might as well transfer
to the People's Hospital.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.960
Our pregnancy timelines
are almost the same.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.039
I'll find an opportunity

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:34.320
to get close to her.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.920
Gradually build a connection.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.479
Flirt indirectly.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.639
Good idea.

00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:40.280
Alright.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880
Zhixia,

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.280
well,

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:49.039
how is Zhilu doing now?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.840
Is she living well?

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.679
Well?

00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:55.559
Basically, as I had expected.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.199
"Zhilu" you mentioned...

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.079
Zhilu.

00:41:59.079 --> 00:41:59.960
Shen Mingzhu.

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:02.119
She's doing pretty well.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.180
She's been learning piano
since elementary school.

00:42:04.182 --> 00:42:05.630
Her awards cover the whole wall.

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:06.550
Much better than me...

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:09.199
Better than Xu Zhidong.

00:42:09.559 --> 00:42:10.989
She really is my daughter!

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.848
Why don't you mention
that her husband died?

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:14.199
Why bring me up?

00:42:14.248 --> 00:42:16.248
If you stay silent,
no one thinks you're mute.

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:23.880
Mom.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.199
Her husband died,
and she can find another one.

00:42:27.039 --> 00:42:31.240
Why does this child
have such a hard life?

00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:32.720
Enough.

00:42:33.479 --> 00:42:34.079
Stop crying.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.760
I'm not dead.
