Master!

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.060
Why so panicked?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.400
What is it?

Master,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.870
I was just serving outside the door...

Changqing,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.000
you didn't hear anything.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.130
But I really did hear it, Master.

[Changqing, a disciple of Chengfo Temple]

It's that...

It's your unsettled heart

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.370
that leads to the noises you hear.

You may leave now.

Even if it means defying my master,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.770
I must speak my mind.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.150
Ever since two months ago,

in the Great Buddha Hall,

the Chengfo Temple has completely changed.

Everyone in Chang'an is

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.480
saying that our temple is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.000
haunted,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800
causing worshippers to dwindle.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.740
Some timid monks

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.530
even left the temple directly.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.910
What on earth are you trying to say?

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.680
Master,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.190
how about we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.870
go find an exorcist?

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:49.960
Shut up!

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.840
You want the prestigious Chengfo Temple

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.240
to recruit an exorcist?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.940
Isn't that the same as admitting

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.870
that there are ghosts in our temple?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.360

He asked for leave at noon

who was so bold

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.870
as to fake women's cries

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.360
in the Great Buddha Hall to scare people.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.830

Abbot,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.070
we didn't find anything.

Beneath this Great Buddha,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.430
there used to be a secret passage
to the Ghost Market.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.360
Could the crying

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.160
be coming from there?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.120
Impossible.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.310
After Feng Han's rebellion,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.510
the government ordered people

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.630
to seal that secret passage

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.830
with huge rocks.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.560
Even if there had been
crying in the Ghost Market,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.240
it wouldn't have reached here.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.830
Look,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.390
the demons and monsters on this wall are

thoroughly covered by cobwebs.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.830
The power of Buddha is infinite.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.270
From now on, if you hear

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.120
any sounds,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.000
don't be afraid anymore.

There's no one in the hall.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.240
It must be the Three Witches crying!

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.190
for you to enjoy.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.240
Don't dive in so fast.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.800
Xijun,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.710
what are these four joys?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.190
Please tell us.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.600
The first joy is

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.190
Master Ji's recovery, of course.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.480
That's thanks to you guys
taking good care of me.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.000
The second joy is

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.830
that you, Lu Lingfeng, have been

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.160
promoted to Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.310
The third joy is

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.070
that, according to His Majesty's decree,

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.040
my sworn brother's been confirmed
as the Criminal Investigation Scholar.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.970
The fourth joy is

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.430
the greatest of all.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.190
It is

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.430
that Xue Huan has become a captain.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.040
I believe

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.250
he must be the Tang Empire's

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.600
youngest captain ever.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.390
Thank you for your guidance, Master.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.800
These first three joys,

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.320
compared to Xue Huan's joy, are

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.040
nothing at all.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.220
Especially you two,

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.800
who used to serve as Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.000
But now, you hold such minor positions.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.680
Fei,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.120
you're wrong.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.390
No matter how high-ranking an official is
in the Tang Empire,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.270
we all serve His Majesty

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.190
and work for the people's welfare.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.920
What's wrong with a minor position?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.120
Does the duty change?

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.770
These are indeed four joys

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.240
worthy of proper celebration.

a toast to everyone.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.360
Come on.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.250

Fei.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.160
Why do you keep stopping me?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.970
Xijun has put in so much effort

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.170
to prepare such exquisite dishes.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.070
Wouldn't it be a waste

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.580
to eat them right away?

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.000
Just looking with your eyes

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.530
without eating
won't satisfy your appetite!

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.350
In my opinion,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.030
we should build on the original dish names

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.150
and give each dish a new name,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.650
which must be poetic and artistic

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.960
to match this beautiful occasion.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.960
Lu Lingfeng,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.840
when did you also become

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.150
so sentimental?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.120
I actually like

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.280
Lu Lingfeng's idea.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.960
Now we've returned to Chang'an.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.160
Life should be filled with more poetry.

As for this shrimp,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.080
let me think.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.630
Though this shrimp is grilled,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.230
it is transparent throughout.

The beacon fire being cold on the armor

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.840
captures both the poetic sentiment
of the frontier

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.750
and the imagery in one's mind.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.910
Great!

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.790
I can see

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.510

Lu Lingfeng,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.710
what I'm most concerned about now

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.870
is my so-called position

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.180
as Criminal Investigation Scholar.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.790
It's not a
regular court official position.

to pay my monthly salary again.

What am I to do?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.600
You have

that special fund

allocated for secret agents.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.120
It must be substantial, right?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.790
Though my scholar rank isn't high,

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.960

His Majesty also approved it.

At the very least,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.960
I should be treated
as a seventh-rank official, right?

Dream on.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.530
One salary is fine too,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.790
but the amount can't be too small.

Her monthly salary

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.870
can be less than mine

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.510
but not by too much.

about going to the cosmetics shop,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.000
but I was afraid you'd think I'm shallow.

Everyone has a love for beauty.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.440
There's nothing shallow about that.

This Chang'an

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.460
is a city

and also a world of its own.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.410
However, it's too vast.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.430
So vast that it makes outsiders

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.320
feel empty inside.

In the world of Chang'an,

Yingtao has no family or friends.

Recently, I bought a box

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.200
of the Fairy Beauty Powder from your shop.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.920
I went home

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.450
and gave it to my wife to use.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480
We thought it would make her beautiful,

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.480
but after applying it,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.140
her face broke out in pimples!

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.940
Tell me.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.680
How will you compensate me?

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.480
You're lying.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.590
Bring your wife to my shop,

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.850
so I can see for myself.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.310
How cruel of you!

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.530
How can a woman

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.290
with a face full of pimples

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.030
casually go out in public?

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.300
How about this?

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.160
You two,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.110
quickly write down

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.440
the recipe for the Fairy Powder

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.920

50,000 coins.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.570

including,

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.440
of course, the recipe
for the Fairy Powder.

Master, you're too merciful.

Yeah. You even refuse to earn the money.

you won't succeed.

Aren't you just trying to
force her to sell the goods?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.060
And who are you?

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.100
I'm someone who doesn't like you.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.550
This is interesting.

So you've hired someone
to guard your shop?

That's right.

And you have such a graceful figure.

coming to my home
to do the night watch work?

They were all nonsense!

should step aside!

Yes.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.530
How is it?

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.630
There are scrape marks

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.840
from bricks and stones on the face.

there's mud and sand.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.810
It indicates that he was drowned to death.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.830
In terms of the states
of his hands and eyes,

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:59.110
if he had jumped into the well by himself,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.920
his eyes would be closed
with clenched fists.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.320
If he had accidentally
fallen into the well,

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.250
his eyes would be slightly open
with curled fingers.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.190
But if he had been pushed into the well
by someone else,

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:13.000
his eyes would be slightly open
with curled fingers, too.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.320
Unfortunately, there are so many
pedestrians coming and going here.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.960
The scene has been badly ruined.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.220
It can't be determined

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.480
whether the victim fell into it by himself

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.540
or was pushed into it by someone else.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.930
What about the time of death?

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.760
It was after 11 PM.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.400
The main streets
were under curfew late at night,

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.360
but inside the district,

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.820
people could move freely.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.520
He was still outside at 11 PM.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.480
I think he had spent time
at a restaurant for pleasure.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:38.240
Captain Xue!

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.820
Mentor.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.190
From now on, in official occasions,

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.390
don't call me Mentor.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.280
Yes.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.110
Official Lu, what can I do for you?

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.710
Go investigate the restaurants
and music clubs

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.110
inside the Shengye District.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:50.880
I've investigated them.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.140
Only one of them stayed open at midnight.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.690
Captain Xue, you got prepared in advance?

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840
After I took up the post of captain,

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.000
this is my first day doing this job.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.360
How would I dare to be careless?

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.840
I've asked someone
to tell the restaurant's owner,

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.370
servants

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.360
and pipa players

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.670
to come here and identify the corpse.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.400
And I've ordered some men
to search the streets

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.060
and check for missing people.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:10.670
Very good.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.400
Official Lu!

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.510
I've brought the restaurant's owner here!

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.230
I've brought Kuai Wu's wife here!

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.800
This child is so pitiful.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.710
Honey!

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.510
-Honey!
-Father!

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.070
Father!

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.190
How did you fall into the well?

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.000
Father!

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.800
Honey!

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.900
[Chengfo Temple]

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.650
[Chengfo Temple]

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.900
Why isn't Wu Yang here yet?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.440
We agreed to meet at 9 AM.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.030
It's almost 10 AM now,

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.630
but there's still no sign of her.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:52.710
Amitabha.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.190
This must be Miss Xijun!

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.450
Greetings, Buddhist Guangxiao.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.190
If I'm not mistaken,

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.320
this must be...

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.520
Madam Shiliu!

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.710
Buddhist Guangxiao.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.090
You're still mistaken.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.290
I'm not Shiliu.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.210
I'm Yingtao.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.410
Madam Yingtao!

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.320
It's been almost a year since we last met.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.150
Are you two
visiting the Chengfo Temple today

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.280
to offer incense?

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.710
How wonderful.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.150
Come on. Please come inside now.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.840
I'll accompany you personally.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.760
I'm sorry.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.000
We'll come again another day
to offer incense.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Today, we're going to
visit the Qu River with a friend.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.190
It turns out you're waiting for someone.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.760
Please make yourselves comfortable.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.890
Take your time to wait for your friend.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:45.850
[Chengfo Temple]

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.070
Let's wait another 15 minutes.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:49.880
If she still doesn't come,

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.670
I won't

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.360
be friends with her anymore.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.400
Maybe her mother is strict with her

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.800
and doesn't let her come out.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.880
Just be a little more patient.
