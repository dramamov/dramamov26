00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.960
What's going on here?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.160
The door is completely blocked.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.960
It won't open.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.560
Yeah, it won't open.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.560
Boss, why is there blood here?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.640
Blood... blood.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480
There's blood here too.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.800
I've got some here too.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.640
There's blood on me too.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.080
I've got blood on me too.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.280
Me too.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.160
First Immortal Gold

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.120
Second Immortal Silver

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.120
Third Immortal brings the Treasure Bowl

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.440
Old Jin, what's this?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.400
Who?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.560
Bro, what's that sound?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.120
Don't panic, it's fine.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.320
Fourth Immortal plants the Longevity Tree

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.280
Fifth Immortal grows the Millennium Ginseng

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.120
Who's there?

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.720
What is this?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.040
What's that? What's happening inside?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.440
It's smoking.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.640
Could something be wrong?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
The greedy snake forgets its tail.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.440
Defying fate leads to death.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.600
Such wickedness.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.520
Darn it, all of them.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.840
The Jin Family dug up the Ginseng King and angered the mountain spirit.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.760
Run!

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.480
Help!

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160
Lord of the Mountain is punishing us, Dad!

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.800
Back in those years,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.520
I led a group of brothers

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.160
refusing to do bandit work.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.520
We only hunted in the mountains.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.920
Once, we ran into a tigress.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.560
Luckily, Big Brother Jin was picking ginseng.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.480
He saved my life from the tiger.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.760
Big Brother Jin in the ginseng guild

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.200
was already highly respected.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.640
That day was especially lively.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280
But who could've guessed

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.040
that day, Big Brother Jin led his clan

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.280
and soon after entering,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.760
around the Mountain Deity Lord's temple,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.640
nothing like this had ever happened.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.640
The temple doors stayed shut.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.120
When the doors finally opened,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.000
Big Brother Jin and the Jin Family

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.000
were all dead, blood everywhere.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.280
Listen up.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.760
Today, turn the Jin Family upside down.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.920
We must find the Nine Immortals' Compass.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.840
Jinzi, oh Jinzi.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.640
We've known each other since childhood.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.120
But now your father angered the Lord of the Mountain.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.840
I never expected this.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.200
Old Jin seemed

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.280
like a decent man outside.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.360
Who knew his heart was so dark?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.560
So filthy inside.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.480
Even the heavens can't stand it.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.280
You know,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.120
when Old Jin came to Guandong,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.760
he married three wives.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.480
Really?

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.040
Not a single child.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.120
Darn it.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.760
All three wives died in the end.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.480
The fortune-teller said he doomed wives and kids.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.840
His fate is tough.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920
But no matter how tough,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.040
he can't beat the heavens.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.680
You two aren't his real children.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.760
No one knows where you came from.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.360
Your Jin Family used the Nine Immortals' Compass to dig up the Ginseng King.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.480
You've enjoyed wealth too long.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.120
This Jin Family,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.200
is finished now.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840
Be smart.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.640
Hand over the compass.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.280
Behave.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.400
You don't know what's good for you.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.280
Beat them!

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.240
Stop hitting, the rest keep searching.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.920
Stop hitting.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
Don't hit him.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.360
Please, stop hitting.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.400
I'm begging you, stop.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.040
Please, I'm begging you, stop.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.240
I'm begging you.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.280
I know where the compass is.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.400
You bunch of bastards.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.080
You don't know restraint.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.400
No pity for the weak at all.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.520
What are you doing, Lin Wancheng?

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.280
Sister Xing'er.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.040
You're the sensible one.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.680
Give the compass to Brother Lin.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.080
Brother Lin promises to treat you well.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.560
Lin Wancheng.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.960
Just let Brother Thirteen go.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.960
I'll take you to get the compass.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.840
Don't trick Brother Lin.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.960
He's still here.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.520
Can't tell him.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
Don't tell him.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.520
Xing'er.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.680
No!

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.840
Xing'er.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.240
Xing'er! Xing'er!

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.040
Let go!

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.960
Xing'er! Xing'er! Xing'er!

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.960
Xing'er.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.920
Xing'er! Xing'er!

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.520
Let go!

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.960
Xing'er.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.680
Release!

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.920
Come.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.520
Don't come closer.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.200
Don't come, Xing'er!

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.040
Xing'er! Xing'er!

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.960
Qiao San'er.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.520
Don't touch me.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.760
Stay away from my sister.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.120
Don't run!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.080
Let go!

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.840
Let me go!

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.080
Qiao San'er.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.960
Xing'er! Xing'er!

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.200
Hurry up!

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.560
Let me go!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.640
Qiao San'er, I'll kill you!

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.080
No!

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.520
I like you!

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.560
Qiao San'er, you scum!

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.360
Hurry up!

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.960
Let me go!

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.360
What do you want?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.040
Xing'er.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.080
What's up?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.920
Don't want to be alone with me?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.200
Or join us all together?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Sure, thanks, Brother San'er.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.360
Thirteen.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.240
Let’s be siblings in our next life.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:08:59.840
No.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.760
No!

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.240
Xing’er.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.760
Xing’er.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.680
Xing’er.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.080
Buzzkill.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.240
Qiao San! Qiao San!

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.360
Lin Wancheng, I’ll kill you!

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.880
Me.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.000
Go! This way. Over there!

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.240
Search over there.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040
Any treasure left over there?

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.120
That box is mine!

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.680
Don’t move.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.360
Come here! Come here!

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.480
I saw it first.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680
Why are you snatching?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.360
Don’t snatch.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.560
Give me this one.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.880
Why can’t it be mine?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.920
First come, first served.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.120
There’s treasure here.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.480
Where is it?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.360
Right here.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.160
Give me a hand.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.040
Coming, coming.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.920
Did you check over there?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.320
Checked. Anything else?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:17.920
Hurry up.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.720
Look at this! Look!

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.480
What is this?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.800
Make sure they’re dead.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.360
Find a place to bury them.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.680
Clean it up.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.240
Hurry! Hurry!

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.040
Move faster, hurry!

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.680
Did you check there?

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.440
Checked, checked.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.600
San, it’s dug.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.320
Bury?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.920
Cut the crap.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.560
Bury.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.000
San, he ran!

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.800
He ran.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.480
Chase!

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.120
Go!

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.240
Kid.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:03.920
Kid.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.920
Kid!

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.880
Don’t move! Don’t move!

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.880
Don’t move.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.560
You’re badly hurt.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.320
Come.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.120
Drink some water. Here.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.240
Slow down.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.680
Slowly, slowly.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.120
Slowly, slowly.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040
Kid, don’t be afraid.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.160
Meeting me means you’re saved.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.720
Behave.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.920
Let me out.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.560
Behave.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.800
Let go! Let me out!

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.160
Don’t move.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.480
Let go of me.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.240
Let go.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.920
Cut the crap! Let me out!

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.800
Behave.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.440
Awake.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.240
Where is this?

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.240
You got tricked here by that old man too, right?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880
He sold you.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.120
That old bastard’s tricked so many.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.120
He only tricks our own people.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.320
To bleed us for the Rakshasa.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.240
That old wretch.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.480
He’ll go to hell sooner or later.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.040
Don’t bother, you can’t get out.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.600
Look at those two.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.920
Honestly, staying here isn’t so bad.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.680
Food and shelter are provided.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.120
Sometimes we even get ginseng to boost us.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.240
They just take us out to bleed a little.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.440
It won’t kill you.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.160
Rakshasa always use blood in their medicine.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.800
Rare, thick blood is the most precious.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.040
Since they go to such lengths,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.480
feeding ginseng to nurture blood,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.120
we can’t escape

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.480
the fate of being drained.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.800
Let me out! Let me out!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.600
You devils from hell!

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.480
You eat flesh and drink blood!

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.720
Let me out! Let me out!

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.600
Why are you yelling? Shut up!

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.320
Why are you yelling? Why are you yelling?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.040
Stop fighting! Stop!

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.920
I’m telling you all—

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.160
Shut your mouths!

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.920
Yell, yell, yell.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.560
Keep yelling, keep yelling.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.480
Why are you yelling?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.240
Are you looking for trouble?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.040
Shut up!

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.680
Trouble.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.920
Trouble.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.560
Still singing.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.440
Sing.
