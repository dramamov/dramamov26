You made it yourself?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.920
Wait a moment.

Jin!

Jin!

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.880
Jin, wait for me.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.310
Jin, wait.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.350
Even if we've had

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.710
our disagreements,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.070
I hope you'll accept

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.400
this painting.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.760
Consider it a gift

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.030
from the old Song Wenchang.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.080
Song Wenchang, listen.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.600
Even if you helped me today,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.940
things between us wouldn't change.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.640
Song Wenchang,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.310
one step closer,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.080
and I'll throw stones at you.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.930
You know

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.780
I'm capable of it.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.590
Today, you've seen it.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.520
I'm neither virtuous

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.870
nor gentle.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.750
I just wanted

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.030
to marry better than my sister

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.230
and wanted to catch your attention,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.230
so I pretended to be
a lady in front of you.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.470
So,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.520
I'm not the Chu Jin

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.360
you thought I was.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.030
Take the painting back.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.590
Jin,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.510
this is a special surprise

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.390
I prepared for you.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.100
Unluckily, I'm not good at painting

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.960
and couldn't capture

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.190
even a fraction of your beauty.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.850
Actually, I've always known

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.470
what kind of woman you are.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.880
Sometimes, you offend people

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.750
without realizing it.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.520
You...

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.040
How can you slander me?

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.080
I...

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.240
I wouldn't dare.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.750
If I did,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.800
I'd trip while walking,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.270
get bitten by a dog,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.120
or get struck by lightning.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.270
I...

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.480
You still care about me?

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.360
Don't flatter yourself.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.240
I just think

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.510
since we have no relationship now,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.830
you don't need to swear like that.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.960
Ever since I met you,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.340
every smile and frown of yours

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.030
makes me prone to overthinking.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.880
Jin,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.430
I like

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.270
the real you.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.030
The principles that stand between us

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.030
will be resolved.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600
But until then,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.030
please let me

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.430
continue to like you.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.480
Whether you like me or not is up to you.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.070
Will you give up

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.630
just because I say no?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.320
No.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.710
Jin.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.320
Jin.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.430
Jin, you agreed, right?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.760
Jin.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.350
Jin, you agreed, right?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.940
(True Might)

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.880
Yun.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.480
You didn't have the meal with us.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.490
Are you still upset with me?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.480
Chun, what you said that day

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.320
wasn't wrong,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.070
but neither is my love for Chu Yu.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.480
Don't blame yourself.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.000
I didn't come today

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.240
to argue right or wrong

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240
with you.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.120
I just want

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.000
to speak my mind.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.840
These words

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.720
are not for our family

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.840
or you.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.510
They're only for Yu.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.000
As a man,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.700
you can't understand
the hardships of a woman.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.000
For a woman,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.870
to commit to a relationship

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.720
requires more courage,

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.000
because we have to sacrifice more.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.430
I believe

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.430
you can protect Yu

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.270
and share

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.830
all her joys and sorrows.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.520
But, Yun,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.680
gossip

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.680
and public condemnation

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.560
are not the most terrifying things.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.830
We can endure inner pain

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.530
and withstand the words of others.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.720
But the most terrifying thing

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.830
is that after we've given everything,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.080
you

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.430
wake up

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.530
from your youthful passion.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.560
- Chun.
- People are fickle.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.830
Besides, you're still so young.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.680
You say you like her

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.840
and love her now,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.270
but can you distinguish between liking,

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.120
dependence,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.960
possession,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.560
and even desire?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.360
How long do you mean

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.600
by forever?

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.710
Chun,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.270
you think I don't know

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.360
if I truly like her.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.000
Then tell me.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.440
How can I tell

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.020
that my feelings for her are real?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.240
Go to a place where she isn't.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.510
Don't see her.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.840
Don't be disturbed by anyone.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.840
Just stay quietly there.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.120
You can meet more women

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.600
and more people.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.720
You'll find that in this vast world,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
there are better women.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.000
You can even try a relationship.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.720
If you still want her

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.720
after seeing the world,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.360
it'll depend

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.000
on your thoughts then.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.720
(The Emperor once told me)

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.850
(about the matters of Qingzhou.)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.220
(I've not yet given an answer.)

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.000
(It's time to make a decision.)

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.700
(Spring Breeze House)

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.960
It seems that you

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.270
are planning to take on

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.210
the mission in Qingzhou.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.590
Xu Lingzhang,
Military Governor of Qingzhou,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.270
has repeatedly defaulted on taxes.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.960
Even when he does pay,

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.600
the amount is always short.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.110
The Emperor intends to investigate

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.550
whether he is lining his own pockets.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.750
I cannot shirk this duty.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.360
But I don't understand.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.510
Since I've been appointed,

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.510
why do you need to go as well?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.610
There are more than just you

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
whom the Emperor values.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.390
This is of great importance

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.200
and cannot afford any mistakes.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.510
There is no need to worry.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.840
I can handle it

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.510
even without you.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.120
You don't seem

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.060
like someone who seeks credit.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.510
Why have you accepted this mission?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.350
Could it be

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.750
to avoid Chu Yu?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.110
I am going

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.840
to figure something out.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.960
Moreover, Qingzhou is on the border.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.550
If we do not resolve this,

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.790
there will be future troubles.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.240
You pride yourself
on serving the country,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.360
yet you're also doing it for yourself.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.910
But I will not put personal desires

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.900
before national affairs.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.070
I have requested the Emperor's decree

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.560
to bring the Song brothers

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560
with me to Qingzhou.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.120
I hope for a pleasant cooperation

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720
with you.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.120
Is your deliberate reminder

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.460
to prevent me from causing you trouble?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.640
I act with courtesy first

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.510
and force if necessary.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.150
But I believe that you

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.750
can prioritize our duties.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.130
As for anything beyond duties...

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.030
We can try our best.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:29.020
(Be Honest and Impartial)

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.440
Father,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.770
we've been holding this for an hour.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.360
You should calm down now.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.560
Besides,

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.480
this vase is quite expensive.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.510
It'd be such a waste to break it.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.080
If you can't even hold a vase,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.870
how can you guard Qingzhou?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.270
You're overestimating yourselves.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.390
The lesson I gave you last time

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.600
was too lenient.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.550
You clearly haven't taken

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.790
my words to heart.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.670
You can't blame us for this.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.270
The Emperor ordered Yun
to guard Qingzhou,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.840
and he recommended us.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.270
If you are angry,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.840
you should reason with Yun.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.150
It's unfair

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.990
to only punish us.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.200
What good would it do to talk to him?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.440
Right now, I want to ask you two

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.390
whether you really want

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.270
to go to Qingzhou.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.680
If not,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.550
I will swallow my pride

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.150
and ask the Emperor

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.550
to revoke the order.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.150
Father,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.600
I don't care. I must go.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.320
I don't want to spend my days

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.490
as a good-for-nothing idler.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.020
I want to prove to Jin

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.390
that I am a man

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.390
who can defend Great Sui

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.630
and protect her.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.580
Wenchang, stop talking.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.270
What an ambitious man.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.110
What about you?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.270
What do you think?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.250
If Wenchang insists on going,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.030
I will stay by his side

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.160
to reassure you.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.200
I'm not asking about him.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.320
I'm asking what you think.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.600
Do you want to go
to the Qingzhou battlefield?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.360
Though you've been working

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.260
in the Ministry of War

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.880
and have shown your skills

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.200
in Dingfeng Valley,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.390
you must understand

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.270
that those experiences are insignificant

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.790
like a drop in the ocean

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.350
compared to a real battlefield.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.750
You need to think this through.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.790
Father,

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.630
I am willing to go.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.120
A man should have lofty ambitions.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.830
As descendants of a military family,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.340
we should charge into battlefields

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.370
and defend our homeland.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.000
Although we are young,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.870
we also want to contribute

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.950
to the people of Great Sui.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.000
Are you indirectly calling me

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.870
a sparrow?

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.240
I don't mean that.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.200
Good.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.870
This is the spirit of our family.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.680
Get up.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.960
Father,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.030
does this mean you agree?

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.350
An old steed still aspires
to travel a thousand miles.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.000
Though I am old,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.630
my ambition

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.720
as a general

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.870
has never been lost.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.270
With Great Sui in turmoil,

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.600
General Chu has requested to return

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.720
to guard Fengling City.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.360
How can we

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.120
stay in Huajing

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.630
and enjoy peace?

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.870
Bring it.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.230
Back then,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.200
it was with this very blade

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.360
that I guarded our western border.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.200
Later,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.200
when Great Sui became stable,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.200
I fell ill.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.360
The physician advised me to rest,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.680
and gradually,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.510
I lost the chance

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.630
to return to the battlefield.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.440
Wenchang,

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.110
I've been remiss

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.120
in teaching you and failed

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.750
to groom you into a pillar of society.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.470
Today,

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.150
I'm extremely gratified

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.390
that you can follow

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.030
the Marquis of Zhenguo

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.470
to guard Qingzhou

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.360
and gain some experience.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.200
Today,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.720
I'll hand this blade

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.630
to you,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.720
hoping that you'll protect the nation

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.240
and achieve great military merits.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.680
Father,

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.230
I know

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.640
that what I am taking over

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.870
is not just this blade

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.630
but also the aspirations

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.480
and backbone

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.800
of our family.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:13.710
Rest assured.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.270
I'll let everyone know

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.000
that your sons

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.480
are not good-for-nothings.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.580
I'll live up to your expectations

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.630
and restore

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840
the vigor of your past.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.790
I know you are not ordinary.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480
This trip to Qingzhou

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.000
is both an opportunity and a test.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.630
Shilan,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.360
I believe in you.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.320
I'm Song Wenchang.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.840
I'm Song Shilan.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.240
We won't fail our mission.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.150
We'll surely guard our nation.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.900
(Be Honest and Impartial)

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.060
(Huajing City)

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.400
By the grace of Heaven,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.070
I now appoint Wei Yun,
General of Huaihua,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.510
to lead troops to Qingzhou.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.720
Left General Song Wenchang,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.310
Right General Song Shilan,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.440
and Supervisor Gu Chusheng
will accompany him.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.590
Chu Linyang, General of Anyuan,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.590
will lead troops to Fengling.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.440
I hope all of you
will not betray my trust

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.510
(Huajing City)
and enhance our nation's prestige.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.960
Thus decreed.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.760
Let's go.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.940
(Sui)

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.720
Why the sudden move to the border?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.520
Is there any movement from North Qi?

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.960
With Young Marquis Wei there,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.750
the border will surely be safe.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.680
Mr. Gu, Mr. Song, and Mr. Chu

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.790
are no less capable.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.160
Wei Yun and Gu Chusheng

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.200
just left like this?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.790
Mr. Song left as well.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.350
I've given up on Song Wenchang.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.480
He chose to fight.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.510
That's his own business.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.930
Don't mention it again.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.200
My lady

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.680
also rejected them.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.200
Now, they left together

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.720
to go to Qingzhou.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.510
Are they planning to make up

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.650
for their romantic failures
with military success?

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.540
What are you talking about?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.030
My Lady, be gentle.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.440
If there really is a war,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.790
who'd be romantic

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.680
on the battlefield?

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.550
I just feel wronged

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.510
for you.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.790
What would I feel wronged?

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.000
They have their things to do,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.680
and I have mine.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.640
Without romance,

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.930
can't I handle important matters?

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.310
I agree with Yu.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.830
Alright, come with me.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.670
Let's go.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.030
You can just go home.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.870
No need to come here.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.200
If you can come, why can't I?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.040
Alright, have it your way.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.310
What about me?

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.440
I'm your sister.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.280
Come down.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.150
Hurry up.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.030
How strange.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.070
I heard that the Eldest Princess

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.400
has many followers.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.960
Why haven't I seen any?

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.480
My lady said

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.680
that the Eldest Princess
has been exhausted

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.950
and has taken those followers

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.780
to enjoy the spring.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.850
So, only some maids

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.000
and guards are left

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.920
in the mansion now.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.260
The Eldest Princess I know

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.880
would never do such a thing.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.210
Has something happened

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.350
to the Eldest Princess?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.160
When Huajing was locked down,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.380
who else could leave Huajing

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.690
except for the Eldest Princess?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.350
I always felt that something
was fishy about Xiang,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.030
but I didn't have any evidence.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.280
Go.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.070
Hurry up.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.910
Let's go.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.000
Wanyue.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.040
Yu,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.720
will there be a mechanism here?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.430
Yu,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.890
(Wonderful Night, Affairs in Chambers)
look at the erotica.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.110
Go over there.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.520
Put them back.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.880
My eyes are hurting.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.350
Come here.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.790
What's wrong now?

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.200
There's blood.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.430
A plum blossom.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.270
Did I help you a lot today?

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.480
Yes.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.600
Your contribution is the greatest.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.790
I knew it.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.070
I must be useful.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.440
You're also a general's daughter.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.890
How could you be useless?

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.630
Wanyue.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.170
(Chu Mansion)
What a surprise

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.690
- Wei Long?
- that you're so sweet.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.190
My Lady.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.670
It really is you.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.560
Didn't you go to Qingzhou with Yun?

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.560
Why are you here?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.510
Can we talk privately?

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.180
Since the Eldest Princess left Huajing,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.680
His Lordship has also been suspicious.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.750
He suspects the Eldest Princess?

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.510
His Lordship thinks

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.510
that the Eldest Princess was suspected

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.620
due to the North Qi assassins
in Qinxi Valley,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.200
especially on the day Xiang confessed,

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.550
but she left Huajing.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.510
Everyone found it very odd.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.750
So he didn't stop

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.750
investigating further.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.920
Has he found the Eldest Princess?

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.670
Near Fengling City,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.960
we only found this hairpin,

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.600
but we couldn't find her.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.290
His Lordship is going to Qingzhou.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.190
Knowing that General Chu
is going to Fengling,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.680
he sent me to bring this hairpin

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.520
to you.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.160
Alright, I understand.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.440
I will look for the Eldest Princess.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.030
Let him focus on Qingzhou.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.160
His Lordship also said

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.310
that Commander Lu is

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.750
also guarding near Fengling City.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.590
You can use him if you need.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.000
Alright.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.920
Pass on a message to him for me.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.660
Tell him to be careful.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.630
Yes.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.820
(Chu Mansion)

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:43.670
My Lady.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.110
My Lady,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.790
let me go with you.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.430
I can also fight.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.440
I won't be a burden

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.440
to you.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.960
I'm going to Fengling.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.070
It's very dangerous.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.960
I know.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.110
I know

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.110
you're asking me to stay in Huajing

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.030
to protect Madam Chu

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.030
and Ms. Chu Jin.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.390
But

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.880
I want to stay by your side.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.150
Wanyue,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.480
I know you want to be my spear.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.030
But my brother and I

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.200
need more support.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.670
Do you understand?

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.200
Yu!

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.440
My Lady, go. I'll stop them.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.680
Yu, don't go.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.590
Why didn't you stop your sister?

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.490
How could I know

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.790
that she'd pack up so quickly?

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.960
Mother,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.920
don't be angry.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.440
I know I was wrong.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.590
Do you still know I'm your mother?

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.830
You're leaving without saying a word.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.200
Do you want to sneak away again?

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.310
Last time, I tried to stop you

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.680
from marrying Wei Jun.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.070
Later, I realized I was wrong.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.680
This time, I think

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.960
you must have your reasons for leaving.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.310
So, I won't stop you.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:08.790
I'm just here

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.510
to say goodbye.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.110
Here.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.510
Take this.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.520
Go.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.000
Remember

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.200
to be careful.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.680
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.680
When you have time,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.200
remember to write to me

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.470
and let me know you're safe.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.830
I'll be waiting for you

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.070
in Huajing.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.550
Mother, go inside.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.400
It's windy outside.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.270
No.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.560
This time,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.510
I want to see you leave.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.070
If you're worried,

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.920
just give her more money.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.550
I'll reluctantly

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680
go with her.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.800
Nonsense.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.400
Is the battlefield a place

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.510
you should go to?

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.440
Why can Yu go

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.310
and I can't?

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.680
What if I insist on going?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.440
Alright, alright.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.440
I'm just teasing you.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.910
Not to mention Fengling.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.230
Even Qingzhou is so far away.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.680
How can I go there?

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.200
What's this?

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.440
Mother is right.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.310
When you have trouble,
don't force yourself.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.830
Just do your best.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.670
You're my only sister.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.310
I don't want to lose you again.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.440
I'm not good

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.920
at making dumplings,

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.510
but you should at least eat one

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.200
on the road for good luck.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.310
You must come back safe and sound.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.550
When you come back,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.960
I'll cook noodles for you.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.240
I don't think

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.000
you're a good cook.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.720
If you weren't my sister,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.000
you wouldn't even get to taste it.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.590
Jin,

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.150
thank you.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.000
Take care of Mother at home.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.230
Take care of yourself as well.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.510
I will surely come back safely.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.030
Yu...

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.920
General,

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.160
we still have some way to go.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.960
Have some water and food first.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.240
General.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.150
General...

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.000
Come out.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.030
I begged Chu Shan

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.440
not to tell you.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.030
If you're angry, blame me.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.880
Do you know

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.990
that I'm heading to Fengling City?

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.040
I know.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.110
I do want to help you

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.750
take care of your health,

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.440
but that's not all.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.680
I am a physician.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.640
Only by traveling can I

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.750
improve my medical skills.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.680
So, I'm going to Fengling City

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.500
to contribute my own strength

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.850
like those soldiers

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.440
on the front line

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.540
and treat the people of Fengling City.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.230
Fengling City is a harsh and cold place.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.400
You can't endure it.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.800
Warfare

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.160
is no joke.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.440
Miss Song, please go back.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.230
It's not far from Huajing here,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.160
and it's still early.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.480
I won't go back.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.640
Everyone treats me

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.790
like a canary in a cage.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.920
Linyang, do you think so too?

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.960
Chu Yu

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.310
grew up in Fengling City.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:46.960
She's so good.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.590
How hard can it be

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.070
in Fengling City?

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.950
Miss Song,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.200
I've made it clear

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.430
in front of the Spring Breeze House

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.400
last time.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.880
I only treat you

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.720
as a younger sister.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.980
I have no feelings for you.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.350
You have lofty ambitions,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.240
and you're not suitable for me.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.070
It's only right for siblings

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.310
to help each other.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.030
Linyang,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.160
if you really see me as a sister,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.640
you wouldn't persuade me to go back.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.820
The more you persuade me,

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.020
the more you care about me,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.080
right?

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.570
While it's not far from Huajing,

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.510
I'll have someone send you back.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.240
Chu Shan,

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.590
escort Miss Song back.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.760
If anything happens,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.960
I'll hold you accountable.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:02.870
Yes.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.720
Linyang.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.560
Organize the troops.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.720
We'll set off now.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.720
Alright.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.910
Miss Song,

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.440
please don't make it hard for me.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.350
Miss Song, let's go.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.840
- Give me a hand.
- Don't dawdle.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.680
Keep up.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.350
Hurry up and follow.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.680
I'm going anyway.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.280
Miss Song.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.960

Miss Song,

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.700
why do this?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.720
The journey is long.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.390
It'll take several days on horseback.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.790
Are you going to run there?

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.950

Move!

(Qingzhou City)

I'm Xu Lingzhang,
Military Governor of Qingzhou.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.360
Greetings, General Wei.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.800
Greetings, Supervisor Gu.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.710
You've traveled a long way.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.630
You must be exhausted.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.470
It is our duty.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.880
No need to stand on ceremony.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.680
You're too kind.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.900
(Xu Lingzhang, Military Governor)
The city is too small

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.030
to accommodate the Wei Army

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.000
in the city.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.860
Moreover,

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.650
if the army were to be stationed
in the city,

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.170
it'd cause panic among the people,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.640
which would be counterproductive.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.840
So...

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.670
I am ashamed.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:47.810
You've considered everything

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.980
for the people.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.690
No wonder they speak highly

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.640
of you.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.000
It's only right for us

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.770
to station outside the city.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.380
Why should you be ashamed?

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.440
Moreover, the Emperor

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.510
has sent us

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.400
to help guard the city

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.280
to ease the people's worries

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.460
about North Qi's invasion.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.160
Indeed.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.360
Among all the officials,

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.300
you're the most diligent

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.550
in submitting memorials,

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.630
covering every detail.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.840
The Emperor also appreciates

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.960
your years of hard work

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.710
and has sent us

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.150
to share your burden.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.390
Alright.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.760
Please come in.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.510
I wonder

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.880
what you meant earlier

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.190
about sharing my burden.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.240
I have noticed

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.610
that the soldiers guarding the city

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.270
(Always Diligent)
all look exhausted.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.030
Why not let them rest well

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.670
and let my army take over the defense?

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.550
We can alternate later

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.440
and take turns on duty.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.590
Mr. Xu,

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.910
what do you think?

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.030
Thank you for your consideration.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.870
However,

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.360
you and your deputies

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.510
have traveled a long way.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.500
You must be very tired.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.770
You need to rest longer.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.150
Besides, my soldiers have been stationed

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.630
in Qingzhou for many years.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.000
This sudden change

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.510
would inevitably cause them

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.350
a lot of doubts.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.360
So I think we should

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.190
talk about it later.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.590
Thanks for your consideration.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.840
But if the Emperor knows

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.360
that our arrival

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.150
hasn't helped you at all,

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.360
he might be upset with us.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.920
General Wei, don't worry.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.880
I will report to the Emperor

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.960
truthfully.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.320
Then I'll leave it to you.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.710
Mr. Xu, you're thoughtful.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.880
Your concerns are reasonable.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.960
General Wei, Supervisor Gu,

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.400
you're both young talents,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.880
handsome and capable.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.840
If only I had

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.510
an unmarried younger sister.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.000
I am curious.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.440
If you had to choose

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.150
between me and Supervisor Gu,

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.190
who would you choose?

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.110
It'd depend on who she likes.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.350
I have official duties to attend to.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.840
Goodbye.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.990
Supervisor Gu,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.200
there are some things

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.910
that you should let go of early.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.630
Don't force it.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.000
I'll say the same to you.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920
Wei Yun came

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.070
and wanted to reassign you

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.730
and replace the city's garrison

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:18.980
with his own men.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.920
The Emperor of Great Sui

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.590
obviously wants to take action
against you.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.880
What consideration?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.510
It sounds very righteous,

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.150
but it is just

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.000
to take away your power.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.360
I am

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.400
really worried for you.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.110
I think I should

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.030
give you a reminder.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.880
Once Wei Yun and Gu Chusheng are dead,

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.280
Great Sui will have
no more capable people.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.030
When the news gets back to Huajing,

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.000
even if the Emperor

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.360
wants to deal with you,

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.800
he will be powerless.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.670
You surely understand how to survive

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.880
when cornered.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.510
Be decisive.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.190
When everything becomes

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.880
a done deal,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.150
I don't think

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.510
you'll have any room for maneuver.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.320
But you can rest assured.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.230
If you cooperate with Mr. Xue,

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.880
he will keep his word.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.030
And I can assure you

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.070
that when the time comes

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.000
for you to rule Qingzhou,

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.030
it will also be the day

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.880
Mr. Xue sends congratulations.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.960
Have I made myself clear,

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.110
Mr. Xu?

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.360
Qingzhou will be

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:07.440
their resting place.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.000
Today, I invited you for a drink

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.670
to catch up

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.630
and

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:18.950
to apologize

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.090
for my unintentional actions.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.400
I've heard a bit about the matter

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.150
among General Wei, Ms. Chu,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.320
and you.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.880
I just didn't expect

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.550
that General Wei

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.000
would embarrass you

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.110
right in front of me.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:36.880
General Wei is young, talented,

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.590
and arrogant.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:42.910
However,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.110
if not for my father,

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.000
I would've already been

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.960
a Minister.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.590
And Wei Yun

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.840
wouldn't have treated me
with such disrespect.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.710
Your father was very kind to me.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.960
If I ever get the chance,

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.360
I will certainly recommend you.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.110
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.880
Supervisor Gu,

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.720
can you explain to me

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.280
what this is?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.800
General Wei, don't be too loud.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.500
She spent

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.820
almost a month on it.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.670
She ruined

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.420
about ten of them.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.150
This one looks the most like her.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.710
Have you seen it enough?

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.360
If you have, give it back to me.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.840
Wei Qiu,

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.400
burn it.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.240
Yes.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.280
Wei Yun,

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.880
do you think that everyone can pretend

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.000
that nothing happened

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.670
once you leave Huajing?

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.440
Who caused Yu to be criticized?

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.330
Who made Yu the target

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.360
of public condemnation?

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.800
Can you say that you don't have

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.510
any covetous intentions towards Chu Yu?

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.550
What are you doing?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.840
How can you hit him?

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:38.950
Young Master.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.360
Guards!

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.710
Guards! The Marquis of Zhenguo...

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.840
Shut up.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:43.910
How dare you!

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:45.050
Stop talking about it!

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:46.630
Stop it!
