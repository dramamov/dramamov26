00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.170
I got here first

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.150
and already saw the body.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.400
It was unbearable to look at.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000
The entire skin of the face
had been peeled off.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.710
What?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.009
Ever-changing Master?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.350
The deceased is a young woman,
about 17 or 18 years old.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.880
She likely died yesterday.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.040
The age

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.240
and time of death both match.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.430
We'll have to transport the body
back to the county office

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.360
and have Chi Ying

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.080
identify it.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.800
as to tear off your face?

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.630
It's my fault, Daughter.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.870
I failed to protect you.

Taking your own life

is meaningless.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.610
We will catch the murderer.

He's okay. It's nothing serious.

but he's actually 2 years younger
than Wu Yang.

He just risked his life to save you.

I hope you can take his words to heart.

did you see clearly?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.310
I did.

What about her build?

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.590
It also matched.

by claiming she can summon spirits,

is mostly about murder and robbery.

deserve to be smashed up?

The reason I'm asking for 3 gold coins

is because this information

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.680
You're...

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.040
He's the Ever-changing Master?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.110
Are you sure?

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.010
I trust you.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.600
Your hearing is the best.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.870
Listen, old man,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.660
we used to hang out together
in the Ghost Market.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.510
I'm the Ghost Market's miracle doctor,

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.240
Fei Qiao, Fei Yingjun,
also known as Chicken Fei.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.310
Come on,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.840
show that dead‑pan face of yours.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.720
It...

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.680
It really is you!

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.090
You, Su something,

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.480
I know you're Master Di's disciple.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.880
But judging by today,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.750
you're nothing more than

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.750
a fool who doesn't know when to quit.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.350
And you useless piece of trash.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.000
Have you gone senile or something?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.880
Have you forgotten

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.480
all my martial skills?

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.610
There are two of us.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.880
It's two against one.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.000
No need for the two of us to take action.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.070
The Three Chang'an Constables

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.240
have already led dozens of men

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.440
to surround this place tightly.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.590
You,

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.400
surrender immediately!

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.440
When you came in just now,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.150
didn't you hear

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.920
a woman crying?

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.780
That was the Night-Wandering Lady I kept.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.830
If there really were constables outside,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.240
it would have flown in

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.520
to warn me already.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.240
I think

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.640
it's you two

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.960
who should surrender.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.750
Don't push me!

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:55.480
Su Wuming!

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.640
Fei Yingjun,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.070
claiming to be
the Medicine King's disciple

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.640
and the Ghost Market's miracle doctor.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.030
Your medical skills

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.550
are nothing but trivial tricks,

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.200
not worth mentioning at all.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.070
Today I'll show you

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.310
how to flay a face alive.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.510
Criminal Investigation Scholar
of Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.920
soon this face of yours

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.060
will be mine.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.470
First thing tomorrow,

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.970
I'll go to the Yongzhou Prefecture Office

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.210
and become a scholar myself.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.920
Wait!

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.840
Let me die knowing the truth.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.310
Let me ask you:

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.860
it was you killed Wu Yang, wasn't it?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.590
We found the body in the Ghost Market.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.200
Her face

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.190
had been skinned off
while she was still alive.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.270
That

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.030
wasn't Wu Yang.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.680
I don't believe you!

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.980
There's a householder at Chengfo Temple
called Chenkong.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.310
He bought two birds from me.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.200
He's truly wealthy.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.240
What he gave me were actually

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.890
gold coins.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.880
I was curious and followed him secretly.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.590
Then I discovered

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.730
he was making the Chengfo Temple
seem haunted

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.610
all for this Wu Yang.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.960
Until one day,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.310
when he was about to kill Wu Yang

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.910
in front of the Great Buddha,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.440
I realized

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.750
that this little girl

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.960
actually resembled

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.310
Empress Wu Zetian in her youth.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.370
I thought I could make a fortune
out of it.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.820
Just think,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.430
the Empress's face

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.160
should be worth
at least 500 gold coins, right?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.310
So

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.720
I knocked Chenkong unconscious,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.240
hoisted Wu Yang onto my back,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.160
left Chengfo Temple,
and entered the back mountain.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.290
But I hadn't gone far

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.920
when I was ambushed.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.110
I even got hit in the butt.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.400
Where is Wu Yang now?

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:22.960
Of course she was

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.120
kidnapped by the attacker.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.350
Then whose body was it
found in the Ghost Market?

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.960
I, the Ever-changing Master,
roaming the martial world,

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.920
had never failed before, you know?

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.920
That really made me furious.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.810
So

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.830
I found

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.110
a girl of similar age

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.490
and flayed her face

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.440
to thoroughly vent

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.870
the anger in my heart!

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.940
This is where I did the flaying.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.510
Then I took the corpse

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.750
and dumped it in the Ghost Market.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.280
Bet you didn't expect that.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.440
You're just a monster!

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.450
Your crimes are unforgivable!

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.640
But

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.790
the one facing death now

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.920
is you.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.480
Taste my blade.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.720
It'll be quick,

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.230
slitting your throat and bleeding you out.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.830
I promise

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.440
you won't feel any pain.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.550
Lu Lingfeng!

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.890
What took you so long?

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.060
Where is he?

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.200
Help!

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.680
Help me!

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.310
It's Fei!

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.310
Help! Help!

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.720
Hurry up! Help!

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.000
Help!

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.640
Hurry!

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.550
You're finally here.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.510
Quick!

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.630
He's dead.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.790
-Help me up!
-He's dead?

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.720
The lead I'd finally obtained

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.110
was ruined by a single kick.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.400
What should we do now?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.960
Give me a break.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.160
If you had kicked any later,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.070
your face would've been flayed!

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.570
You're really something.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.640
Fei,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.640
examine his wounds immediately.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.350
If he was telling the truth,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.050
then Wu Yang is still alive.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:27.830
This...

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.760
Xue Huan, quick,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.360
help me pull down his pants.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.600
This wound on his buttock

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.650
is very similar to the one

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.020
on Liu's shoulder.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.750
The armor-piercing awl?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.830
[Yongzhou Prison]

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:51.270
Hurry!

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:52.920
Move!

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.790
Who are you?

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.590
Didn't you claim

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.790
you could only fall asleep

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.160
under the Great Buddha?

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.880
You know what,

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.110
since I was thrown into
the Yongzhou Prison,

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.070
the food has been good,

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.600
so I've been sleeping well.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.640
What did you do to Wu Yang?

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.720
Wu Yang?

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.260
Wasn't she kidnapped?

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.570
How would I know what happened to her?

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.200
Torture him.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.270
What kind of disciples
of Master Di are you,

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.160
torturing an old man?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.660
You claim I killed Wu Yang.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.420
What evidence do you have?

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.840
That day,

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.640
after Chenkong kicked you
out of Chengfo Temple,

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.640
you didn't leave.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.680
Soon after, you saw

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.070
Physician Bai carrying Wu Yang,

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.880
leaving through the back door
of the Chengfo Temple

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.400
and heading toward the back mountain.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.920
You ambushed him,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.110
wounded him with an armor-piercing awl,

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.310
and took Wu Yang away.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.640
Since you've figured it all out,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.440
I'll confess.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.840
I, Li Fengjie,

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.640
will go down in history eventually,

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.200
because

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.160
I've drowned that demon empress

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.750
in the Qu River,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.920
never to be reincarnated again.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.630
Old man.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.850
Why are you doing this?

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.440
The only thing to blame is that
you look too much like that demon empress.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.550
I, Li Fengjie,

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.790
am merely atoning for my past sins.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.800
All because of that woman

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.240
who I've never even met?

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.790
No remorse at all

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.550
yet full of excuses.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.210
Someone as shameless as you

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.560
is not worthy of calling yourself
a Tang citizen!

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.880
You're a bad person—

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.960
a bad person who's gotten old.

I must learn how to swim.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.980
The one underwater now

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.470
shouldn't be Master.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.070
You still have a lot to learn.

Don't rush.

It's been two days.

Even if we find the iron cage,

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.720
Wu Yang must have...

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.770
He's out!

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.790
-He's come out!
-Lu Lingfeng!

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.010
Be careful.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.510
Quick,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.440
put this on.

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.350
He's alright.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.200
He's alright.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.240
No one's in there.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.100
Could she have been eaten by fish?

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.720
Near the iron cage,

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.980
I didn't find any body,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.270
only these items.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.230
This rope

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.440
appears to have been cut by a knife.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.070
This is good news.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.000
Perhaps Wu Yang is still alive.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.830
Someone rescued her

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.840
and then abducted her again?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.100
This is just unbelievable.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.930
She's just an ordinary woman.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.400

Forget the tea.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.240
When will the case be closed?

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.880
It will take some more time.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.840
I can't wait anymore!

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.640
You...

This is all your fault.

How is this my fault?

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.550
I'm just a humble scholar.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.440
Even my monthly salary

isn't paid by your Yongzhou Prefecture.

You dare say

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.200
that bringing judicial officers
into the district for case investigation

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.400
wasn't your idea?

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:02.370
If you, Chief Administrator Du, say so,
then it must be.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.750
Wasn't that a good idea?

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.760
You call it good?

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.630
A woman went missing in Shengye District,

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.550
and now all of Chang'an knows about it!

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.840
If the officials hadn't come to
the district for case investigation,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.650
would this have happened?

[Discipline and Service]

the Great Buddha Hall at Chengfo Temple

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.590
in the middle of the night

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.710
to clean the murals.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.590
And what happened?

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.360
You released all the demons

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.230
that were sealed away

behind the dust and cobwebs!

My dear Chief Administrator Du,

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.920
you actually believe that?

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.320
I don't have to,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.760
but the common folks are all
spreading it.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.710
And once a rumor spreads long enough,

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.170
won't it eventually be heard
by His Majesty?

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.920
Although the ages don't match,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.280
the missing woman

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.440
has still been wildly rumored
among the townsfolk

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.969
to be the reincarnation
of Empress Wu Zetian.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.630
Yin,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.630
what do you think?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.060
Can a person really be reincarnated?

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.190
Perhaps.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.880
Otherwise,

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.800
how could I have dreamed of

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.260
you and me in our next life?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.630
When I was little, I was terrified of
seeing the Empress.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.670
I was even

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.100
afraid to enter the palace because of it.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.960
Now,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.040
although I've become
the master of the palace,

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.000
I'm restless day and night because of

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.330
an ordinary woman from Shengye District.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.270
Aren't I, as Emperor,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.030
somewhat pitiful?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.930
Your Majesty is worrying too much.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.750
Tonight, I'll prepare an extra portion of

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.750
gastrodia powder

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.330
to help Your Majesty sleep.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.790
I once said

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.440
I wanted to meet that woman called Wu Yang

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.590
and take her in as my adopted daughter.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.790
But unexpectedly...

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.920
It's said that woman was targeted

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.190
all because of her looks.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.230
However, there's a rumor

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.590
that she is the reincarnation
of the Empress

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.510
—that she didn't actually die,

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.240
but simply ascended to heaven.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.440
Do the people of this world

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.320
love my mother

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.030
or

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.400
hate her?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.160
Even a perfect person

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.880
will have people who envy them,

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.810
and some may even

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.630
turn love into hatred.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.620
Mother encouraged agriculture,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.120
imposed light taxes,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.740
promoted irrigation,

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.630
and established the military farm system.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.000
During her reign,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.800
although there was intrigue in the palace,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.820
the common people lived in peace,

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.880
and the granaries were always full.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.230
The population of our Tang Empire

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.070
grew by well over a million!

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.710
Mother also perfected
the imperial examination system,

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.150
giving commoner scholars the chance
to enter officialdom.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:54.150
At that time, it could truly be said
that all nations came to pay tribute.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.360
Such a great Empress,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.960
yet some people hated her.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.230
Could it really be

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.880
just because she was a woman?

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.390

Qin Xiaobai was possessed

[Chengfo Temple]

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.530
Official Lu.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.840
It's broad daylight.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.770
Why did you close the temple gates?

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.280
Those who come to the temple now
aren't pilgrims.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.110
They're all here to insult Master.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.190
Besides closing the door,

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.320
what else can we do?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.590
How is

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.820
your Master doing?

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.440
He has been fasting for many days.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.320
He won't take any food or water.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.710
He won't listen to anyone.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.240
I'm afraid he intends to...

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.760
Attain parinirvana.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.520
Buddhist Guangxiao,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.930
why are you doing this to yourself?

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.630
In this life,

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.440
I've accumulated merits,
done good deeds only,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.100
and devoted myself to Buddha.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.510
I've never done anything evil.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:18.550
All I wish is to achieve
complete spiritual merit.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.170
But who would have thought

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.590
I'd end up being accused as
a murderer by the public

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.000
and be reviled?

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.840
What's the point of my meditation

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.210
and worship of the Buddha anymore?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440
I might as well

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.960
remain here in quiet extinction

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.960
and go to the Western Paradise

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.030
to meet the Buddha sooner.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.920
My mind is made up.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.670
Please don't try to persuade me,
gentlemen.
