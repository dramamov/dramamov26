00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.320
What do you mean by Mountain Vision?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.280
The elders used to say,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.920
that it's the mountain spirit appearing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.200
It lets the chosen ones see visions.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.200
But some say, late at night in the woods,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.360
certain plants release gases

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760
that might cause hallucinations.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.360
Jin Shisan,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.920
look.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.040
Look over there.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.400
Hallucinogenic mushrooms.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.520
Maybe they're the reason.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.560
Jin Shisan, be careful.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.480
Found it!

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.000
Jin Shisan.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.720
Jinzi.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.800
I'll hold the rope for you.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.600
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.800
Jinzi—Jinzi!

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.320
Jin Shisan.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.520
We'll wait for you at Diqiangzi.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.520
Brother Luo.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.160
How deep is this cave?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Why haven't we reached the bottom?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.160
Amitabha, Heavenly Lord, God, Jesus—

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.520
Please keep Jinzi safe.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.200
Jin Shisan.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.520
Let's go.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.480
Phoenix's Single Tear.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.200
I really didn't expect this.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.040
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng
and Phoenix's Single Tear
actually grow together.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.320
We must harvest both ginsengs at once.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.480
Otherwise,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.920
they'll be startled and disappear.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.640
You harvest the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.320
I'll take the Phoenix's Single Tear.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.760
Okay.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.480
I think I've found the ginseng.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.000
Come.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.440
Do as I say.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.640
Center on the ginseng.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.920
Keep a distance of three chi three.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.440
Shunzhi coin in the east, wood position.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.320
Yongzheng coin in the west, metal position.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.920
Qianlong coin in the north, water position.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.480
Jiaqing coin in the south, fire position.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.760
Kangxi coin in the center, earth position.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640
Good thing you're here.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.640
Be careful.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.240
Star-dotted capillary twin-stem reed.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.880
Human-shaped, diamond short dragon root.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.320
Deep pouch, fine-scaled, snake-patterned skin.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.520
Dragon-twined whiskers with pearls hanging.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.480
Shisan.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.240
Do you still remember this chant?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.880
Look at this ginseng.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.840
Twin reeds, star spots.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.400
Snake pattern, dragon whiskers.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.280
This second layer,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.080
is already a rare treasure among ginsengs.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.520
Your Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.760
is the supreme ginseng.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.400
Father.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.320
I've harvested the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.400
Don't move.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.320
Do you—do you have a plan?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.760
No plan.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.960
I'll count to three.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.680
Then we run.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.760
Okay.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.520
One.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.520
Two.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.120
Go!

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.880
Go!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.400
Jin Shisan.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.000
Jin Shisan.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.840
Jin Shisan.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.520
Jin Shisan.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.440
Jin Shisan, where are you?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.440
Jin Shisan.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.440
Jin Shisan, is that you?

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.520
Don't come over.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.520
Don't come over.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.280
Don't come over.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.640
Don't come over, don't come over!

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640
No, don't!

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.440
No, don't!

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.120
Ruyi.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.960
Yang Ruyi.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.200
I—

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.880
I—I can't move.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:27.840
Ruyi.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.280
You've been poisoned by that giant python.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.200
You fainted as soon as you entered the tree hollow.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.320
Jin Shisan saved you.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.080
It hurts all over.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.640
Ruyi.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.320
Take this antidote pill I have.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.520
It can help slow the spread of the venom.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.840
But we need to get back to town quickly.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.440
Only then can we find a way to cure you.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.000
Jin Shisan.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.120
Time is running out.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.440
We need to get down the mountain fast.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.840
Take care of her.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.840
Don't worry.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.760
You'll be fine.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.640
Jinzi.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.640
Almost packed up.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.520
Jinzi.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.440
How's Yang's bloodhound?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.200
Awake.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.320
Poisoned by a snake.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.760
We need to get down the mountain quickly.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.760
I checked.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.560
The mountain wall of Qinglong Ridge faces southeast.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.320
If we follow the cliff,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.280
it should be the fastest way down.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.120
No.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.840
We can't go southeast.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.000
Yesterday, we ran into a Spirit Wall.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.200
So I observed

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.320
the plants in this forest.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.560
They look chaotic,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.000
but there's a hidden pattern.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320
Actually, this is

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.640
a naturally formed Bagua Zhen
(Eight Trigrams Formation).

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.400
Look.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.200
North is straight ahead.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.280
North is the Gate of Misfortune, Kan.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.680
The entrance we used

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.680
is the Gate of Harm.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.200
The Harm Gate is Zhen.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.440
It's due east.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.960
It brings illness and disaster.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.400
Qinglong Ridge is at the Gate of Life.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.200
The Life Gate is Gen.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.840
It nurtures all things.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.280
Located in the northeast.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.960
It gives life to water, so water flows.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.120
It gives life to people, so people thrive.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.520
Nurture brings forth growth.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.200
So, at the foot of this cliff,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.400
we found the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.680
Based on this,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.280
if we want to leave this forest safely,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.520
we must head northwest.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.880
Take the open path.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.320
The open path lies in the Qian position.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.320
That's in the northwest.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.120
It leads to smooth passage.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.200
Clear and unobstructed.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.280
Even with changes, it remains undisturbed.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.280
That is called harmony.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.200
Alright.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.840
Jin Zi.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.000
Let's pack up our things,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.080
and get ready to leave anytime.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.200
Go, go.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.560
Haiyue.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.400
Eunhee.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.760
That's your real sister.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.680
What does it matter?

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.320
Family can't fill your stomach.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.000
We're all serving our own masters now.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.120
Jin Shisan.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.640
What did you do to Ruyi?

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.200
Yang Tingxuan, you lapdog.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.960
Look carefully.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.000
If not for us,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.280
your sister would've died long ago.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.680
She was poisoned by a snake.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.840
It's urgent.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.960
We need to get down the mountain fast.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.280
Only the leader you captured, Cui,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.440
can save your sister.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.400
Boss Jin.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.200
Sorry about this.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.840
Just hoping Boss Jin will spare us a meal.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.520
The forest is huge.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.400
If you want ginseng,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.320
use your own hands.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.960
Any forest Boss Jin has visited,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.760
there's no good ginseng left.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.640
Be smart.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.080
Hand over the ginseng treasure.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.440
Here, take it.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.400
This is top-grade ginseng with four leaves.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.000
Take it.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.680
Let her go.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.080
This isn't Boss Jin's doing.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.560
Hurry up.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.640
Hand over the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
Or I'll shoot her.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.200
Haiyue.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.520
Seems you know our situation inside out.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.640
Ever since we met you in the forest yesterday,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.880
your every move

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.000
has been under our watch.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.960
