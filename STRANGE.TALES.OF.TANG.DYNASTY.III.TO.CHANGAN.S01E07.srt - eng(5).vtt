[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 7]

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.840
[Shengye District]

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.310
Madam,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.039
please think carefully—

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.950
did Kuai Wu have any enemies?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770
My husband never bore grudges
against anyone.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.400
[Kuai Wu's Wife]

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.120
Really!

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.150
Everyone knows he

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.430
loved making friends

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.789
and loved bragging.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.180
Last night, we

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.000
[Kuai Wu's Friends]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.039
were drinking while listening to Kuai Wu

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.170
tell stories about Empress Wu Zetian.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.040
The events that happened
during the Empress's reign.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.760
How well did he usually hold his liquor?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.420
Quite well.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.040
Though he drank a lot yesterday,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.009
with Kuai Wu's tolerance,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.720
he wouldn't have been drunk.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.710
Kuai Wu wasn't drunk last night,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.320
but he definitely drank his fill.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.590
[The Owner of the Restaurant]

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.120
He wanted to see
the foreign dancers perform,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.240
but our restaurant hadn't hired any.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.360
And it was too late at night,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.090
so I had these three perform...

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.360
Official Lu.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.590
He's Official Lu.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.310
Who else was

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.320
at your restaurant last night?

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.560
There were two other groups of customers.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.860
Were they regulars?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.620
No.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.630
There were three men

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.890
who seemed to be merchants from Luoyang.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.030
And there were two others.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.490
They were very secretive.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560
I saw one of them,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.750
dressed like a wandering hermit,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.840
give the other person

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.000
three gold coins.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.740
Regarding those two mysterious men,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.280
think carefully again—

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.130
were there any other details?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.970
The more specific, the better.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.070
When I was dancing,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.390
that wandering hermit toasted Kuai Wu.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.710
I remember too.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.840
He did offer a toast.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.430
My good sir,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.530
I'd like to make a toast to you.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.910
That story

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360
was fascinating.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.630
You heard that too?

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.900
I was fortunate to overhear it
and enjoyed it very much.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.660
Bottoms up!

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.560
Did you all hear

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.530
that hermit's words clearly?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.960
Yes, we heard clearly.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.090
That's what he said.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.950
You may go now.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.120
I need to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.190
go question those two who were drinking

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.850
with Kuai Wu more thoroughly.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.870
Okay.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.770
Come in!

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.870
You two have some nerve.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.470
You even dared to lie

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.870
to Official Lu.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560
No, Sir!

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.800
Everything we said

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.680
was true!

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.680
Yes, yes, we did.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.779
Then let me ask you,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.950
last night at the restaurant,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.950
were you talking about

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.270
Empress Wu Zetian

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.760
or events that happened during her reign?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.610
Speak honestly!

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.950
It... it was about Empress Wu Zetian.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.040
We didn't say anything.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.430
K-Kuai Wu said all those things.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.960
Yes, yes.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.560
I even tried to stop him.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.480
And what exactly did he say
about the Empress?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.240
Still won't confess?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.840
Are you asking for a beating?

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.320
-We wouldn't dare.
-We wouldn't dare.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.970
Quite the story, isn't it?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.159
So you see,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.270
what's recorded in the Chronicles of Shasi

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.870
is just

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.950
the tip of the iceberg.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.920
Is that true?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.430
You never served Empress Wu Zetian

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.390
in the palace.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.310
I think

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.030
he's making it all up.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.720
Everyone knows how formidable

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.920
the Empress was.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.680
Believe it or not.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.630
Let's drink. Drink up.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.430
Anyway,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.480
tonight

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.580
I've finished telling the story
about Mr. Shen.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600
But before him,

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.120
there were Ming Chongyan and Xue Huaiyi.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.870
And next

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.040
come the tales about the two Zhangs.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.870
Speaking of those two Zhangs...

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.610
Want to hear it?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.240
If you want to hear more,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.240
you'll have to buy me another round!

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.000
Shopkeeper!

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.600
Bring me

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.720
two foreign dancers!

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.720
Sir, have mercy!

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.000
Just now, in front of everyone,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.720
I really didn't dare to say that.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.070
I...

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.960
That won't be necessary.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.510
Oh no!

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.310
Something terrible has happened!

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.830
Something terrible has happened
in our family!

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.120
Move! Make way!

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.890
This is bad! This is bad!

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.680
My daughter is gone.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.540
She's missing!

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.560
Don't panic.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.310
What's your daughter's name?

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.370
Her name is Wu Yang.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.070
How old is she?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.730
Seventeen.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.950
When and where

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.630
did you last

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.310
see her?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.160
Last night,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.870
at home.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.750
Since she's an adult

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.240
and has only been gone one night,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.500
we can't easily conclude she's missing.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.240
You, Judicial Official,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.310
are you just for show?

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.510
Or are you just being arrogant?

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.870
If you don't believe me,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.600
come to my house and see for yourself!

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.330
Official Lu.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.670
Come on, let's go take a look.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.470
Come on, this way.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.830
Hurry up! Faster!

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.510
Over here. Come in, come in.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.200
Her room is upstairs!

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.730
Come in.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.120
Come up quickly.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.159
Look.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.790
The lock's been smashed.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.190
And inside...

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.010
Here!

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.430
Look!

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.380
Look at how messy this room is.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.740
The window is open too.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.360
It's obvious that some criminal broke in

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.890
and kidnapped my daughter.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.000
Do you

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.200
lock your daughter's room every night?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.430
Not always.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.310
Last night I had to go out,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.360
and I was worried,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.490
so I locked the door.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.430
It was improper of me
to make those remarks

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.720
without investigating

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.650
your home first.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.630
Please forgive me.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.270
Then please hurry

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.270
and find my daughter.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.950
Send out all the constables

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.000
in the prefecture.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.950
I understand you're worried

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.610
about your missing daughter,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.200
but you need to stay calm.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.720
Give us more clues

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.780
so we can find her as soon as possible.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.480
Okay.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.400
Where did you go last night?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.070
That's irrelevant to this case, isn't it?

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.670
How could it not be relevant?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.920
If we don't even know

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920
where you went

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.120
on the night your daughter went missing,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.630
how can we investigate the case?

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.750
So, where did you go?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.280
Speak up.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.630
I'm taking notes.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.390
I...

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.930
I went to Baifeng House.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.510
Baifeng House?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.270
What kind of place is that?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.470
What did you do there?

I did that for her own good.

keep her from going out.

Our master

He seems quite formidable.

I'm not formidable.

Who is Mi Ba?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.630
He's our muscle,

We're friends of

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.630
your daughter, Wu Yang.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.030
Yes.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.910
We planned to go to
the Qu River together today

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.550
and agreed to meet at Chengfo Temple.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.750
But she never showed.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:40.910
You...

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.250
You made plans with Wu Yang?

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.360
How dare you?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.600
How dare you make plans with Wu Yang
without my permission?

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.330
How dare you!

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.620
What are you doing?

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.350
Step back.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.960
You helped me yesterday,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.320
and I'm grateful for that.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.030
But

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.080
you cannot make plans with Wu Yang
behind my back.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.740
You cannot!

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.840
It was Wu Yang's idea.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.510
We were just

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.840
going out together for fun.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.839
Going out for fun?

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.349
What if something had happened

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.410
while you were out?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.400
Well, something did happen!

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.930
Chi Ying!

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:13.069
Taking your anger out on innocent people
is pointless.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.530
If you want to find Wu Yang,

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.680
you need to provide more clues.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.349
Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.400
I'm sorry.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.400
I'm sorry.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.110
Wu Yang has

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.350
no relatives or friends in Chang'an,

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.070
and she hadn't had a fight
with her mother,

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.090
so she was most likely kidnapped.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.210
The motive for the kidnapping...

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.640
is probably related to the skincare shop's

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.750
booming business.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.510
Well, is that Fairy Beauty Powder

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.910
any good?

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.070
It's alright.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:46.750
Well...

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.350
could you give me some?

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.550
I just want to know

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.680
what ingredients are actually in it

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.270
and how it's making so much money

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.670
that people are envious.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.810
Mr. Fei,

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.110
take it all.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.440
If we can't find Wu Yang,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.100
I don't want to use it anymore.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.350
The landlord must know

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.900
the skincare shop makes good money.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.160
I've looked into the landlord.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.220
His name is Yu Gong.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.790
He used to be in
the colored glass business.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.550
Later, he made a fortune

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.750
and bought many shops

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.160
specifically to rent out.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.720
How about

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.640
I send someone to follow him secretly?

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.720
Secretly.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.350
Then we need to send secret agents.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.320
Tail who?

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.010
See?

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.830
Such a wonderful secret agent—

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.310
paying her 2,000 coins per month

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.510
isn't too much at all.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.960
Wuming, the portraits are done!

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.350
This one

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.310
is the wandering hermit
who toasted with Kuai Wu.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.240
Though his hair is all white,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.830
he can still be considered

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.960
a handsome man.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.860
Almost as handsome

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.030
as me.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.880
He's not as handsome as you.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.610
You think so?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.070
This one

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.550
is the mysterious man
who was drinking with the hermit.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.550
Though he doesn't look vicious,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.520
he's certainly not a good sort!

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.880
This one

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.160
is Wu Yang.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.240
This is Wu Yang?

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.400
In just two hours,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.440
Xijun

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.590
has completed three portraits.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.780
Even if Qin Xiaobai wasn't blind,

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.880
he couldn't have done...

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.540
Master Fei!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.170
Please don't say that.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.270
I only meant...

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.140
y-you're better than him.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.160
Not at all.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.680
I just draw more realistic likenesses.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.310
The way that Master Qin captures
the essence

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.240
is something I may never achieve
in my lifetime.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.030
So modest.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:45.790
Xijun.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.280
Did you draw the wrong girl?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.110
What do you mean, Wuming?

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.750
Yingtao and I have both seen Wu Yang.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.880
I couldn't have gotten her wrong.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.920
This is exactly what Wu Yang looks like,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.120
down to every detail.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.310
Su Wuming,

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.520
what's wrong?

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.940
If that's the case,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.400
this case becomes even more bizarre.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.110
Su Wuming,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.520
what do you mean?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.160
I can't be certain yet,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.510
so I'd rather not say.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.270
Xijun,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.270
I need to borrow this portrait.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.720
Being all mysterious.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.650
What's going on?

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.720
Hey,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.790
I bought
two Scallion and Vinegar Chickens.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.750
Why don't we have a drink together?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.310
I'll go stake out the landlord.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.840
Xue Huan,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.160
give me the address.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.520
-We…
-The door lock was smashed.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.480
It must have been
a home-invasion kidnapping.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.280
There must have been some noise.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.830
Why didn't the neighbors report it?

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.960
I'll go question Chi Ying's neighbors,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.690
door to door.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.590
If Wu Yang were truly kidnapped,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.070
the perpetrators would certainly
contact Chi Ying,

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.070
demanding money

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.000
or the formula for the Fairy Powder.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.260
I'll go watch Chi Ying.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.400
Xijun.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.440
I bought two
Scallion and Vinegar Chickens.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.510
Why don't you join me for a drink?

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160
I...

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.680
I understand.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.550
You've been drawing for two hours,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.750
which has taxed your mind

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.960
and strained your eyes.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.290
You need a break, right?

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.970
Go ahead.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.980
Thank you, Master Fei.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.600
To think that I, Chicken Fei,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.070
have spent years
hanging around the Ghost Market,

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.440
always eating and drinking alone.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.590
Now that I have

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.480
a home,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.790
I'm not used to being alone anymore.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.480
On the first day of

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.510
the Yongzhou Judicial Court's
citywide circuit

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.550
[Crucial Nexus]

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.750
in Shengye District,

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.960
we were honored
by Your Highness's gracious presence.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.880
On behalf of all my colleagues

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.880
at the Yongzhou Judicial Court,
I, Su Wuming,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.410
thank Your Highness
for your great kindness!

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.720
I only came to see my son from afar,

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.320
yet you still noticed me.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.790
Coming this late,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.800
you're not just here
to say thank you, are you?

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.830
Nothing gets past Your Highness.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.070
There is another matter...

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.480
I already knew.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.210
Yongzhou Prefecture won't pay your salary.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.750
That Du Ming

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.920
looks honest and straightforward,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.880
but he's actually an old fox.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.400
Once I kick him out of Chang'an,

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.550
you'll

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.590
take his place.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.160
Your Highness misunderstands.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.510
The salary

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.070
is not worth mentioning.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.310
The reason I've come

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.110
is to ask Your Highness to help me

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.790
look at a drawing.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.670
A drawing?

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.610
Your Highness, please take a look.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.510
Who drew this?

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.640
My sworn sister, Pei Xijun.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.350
It seems

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.720
I wasn't mistaken.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.920
The woman in the painting does resemble

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.380
Empress Wu Zetian in her youth,
doesn't she?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.270
Isn't this the Empress herself?

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.960
No.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.030
She's a commoner from here,

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.590
named Wu Yang.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.440
I can't believe such a woman exists.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.080
The dragon eyes, phoenix neck,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.970
square forehead, and broad chin.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.640
She looks just like my mother
in her youth.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.920
Bring her to me.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.920
I want to take her as my goddaughter.

She's missing.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.680
And according to my deduction,

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.940
her disappearance

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.400

But as for how they're combined,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.920
we can only guess for now.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.440

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.970
Take them into custody.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.350
It was slumbering incense.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.240
Slumbering incense?

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.350
Whoever used this incense is an expert.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.310
This incense is extremely expensive.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.680
Common thieves couldn't afford it.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.160
What kind of slumbering incense
is it exactly?

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.440
Do you remember when we investigated

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.550
the Human-Faced Flower case in Luoyang—

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.350
the one that Hu Shiniang used...

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.840
The Husband's Incense?

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.130
This time it's Wife's Incense.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:13.880
Got it?

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.720
If someone used slumbering incense

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.050
to knock out the guards
and rescue Wu Yang,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.590
why didn't she go home?

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.350
Then we can't rule out the possibility
that whoever rescued her

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:25.830
also kidnapped her again.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.200
Wu Yang is just an ordinary woman.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.800
Even if that Fairy Beauty Powder

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.560
is exquisite

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.610
and profitable,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.110
it shouldn't draw so many

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.830

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.550
Now it seems this case

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.680
is not only bizarre but also significant.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.330
Did you find anything?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.880
She looks very much like someone.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.270

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.490
Not just somewhat similar.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.740
Her appearance and expression

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.480
are identical to the Empress

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.480
in her youth!

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.440
I see now.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.750
This is no longer just about

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.960
some Fairy Beauty Powder.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.350
I've looked into that powder.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.270
There's nothing special about it.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.510

unique.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.510
It's mainly because

Wu Yang resembles...

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.270
Her resemblance must be a coincidence.

Perhaps

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.640
this is just an ordinary

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.790
I'm not a god.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.600
I'm just a mortal, aren't I?

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:39.730
Mr. Tao,

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.200
don't play dumb with me.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.400
You know it very well.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.920
The Great Buddha Hall is closed

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.200
and no longer receives worshippers.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.920
You're allowed in during the day

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.960
to pray

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.070
only because you donated 10 coins

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.350
when it was being built.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.280
But not at night.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.270
But if I'm not beside the Buddha,

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.640
I c-can't sleep well.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.880
Sounds like you've got
a guilty conscience.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.410
I'm just a charcoal seller.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.570
I sell good charcoal

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.510
at affordable prices to

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.680
the people of Chang'an.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.070
What wrong could I have done?

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.510
Only you know if you have.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.540
Let me tell you:

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.610
if you have no home,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.670
find another place to stay in the temple.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.550
But the Great Buddha Hall is off-limits.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.400
Buddhist Guangxiao put me
in charge of this hall,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.550
and I have to do my duty.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.370
Go back now.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.920
Wait! Let me tell you...

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.760
How could she get in?

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:23.960
She...

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.510
I can't enter the hall,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.510
yet you let a woman

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.030
stay in the Great Buddha Hall?

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.000
You householder,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.460
what are your intentions?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.320
Mr. Tao,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.190
you can't go in!

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.230
I'll just rest for a while,

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.280
then I'll leave.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.150
-Don't stop me.
-How can you barge in?

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.030
Get out now!

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:41.739
Mr. Tao!

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.130
Get down right now.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.840
Get down!

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:49.030
Let me sleep for a while.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.760
Isn't there someone else here?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.170
That's Chi Ying.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.400
When the Great Buddha was built,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.840
she donated 5,000 coins.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.000
Besides,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.710
her only daughter's gone missing.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.040
She's here to pray for Buddha's blessing.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.700
I'm also here to seek Buddha's blessing.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.360
I sleep so peacefully

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.160
right at the Buddha's feet.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.360
Are you leaving or not?

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.090
If you won't,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.880
I'll go get Buddhist Guangxiao

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.550
and have him drive you out with his staff!

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.550
No, please don't.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.130
Spare this old man for now.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.400
Just for a moment.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.950
I'll leave when she does.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.150
Buddha, please bless my daughter

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.070
and bring her home safely tonight.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.480
Let her come home tonight.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.440
Please bless my daughter

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.630
and bring her home safely tonight.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.160
Chi Ying.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.650
It's getting late.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:31.970
You should go home now.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.760
You're devoted to the Buddha.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.360
The Buddha

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.970
has heard your prayers

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.230
and will surely manifest to help you.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.430
Please go home first.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.480
Buddha, please bless my daughter

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.440
and let her come home tonight.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.840
Did you hear me?

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.030
Please bless my daughter.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.280
Are you going to leave or not?

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.710
Buddha, please bless my daughter.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.570
Please let her come home tonight.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:51.840
Please let her come home tonight.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.700
Please let her come home tonight.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.970
[Great Buddha Hall]

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.760
Wu Yang?

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.360
Wu Yang!

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:34.880
Wu Yang.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.480
Wu Yang?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:38.780
Wu Yang.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:39.800
Wu Yang?

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.480
Daughter, I heard you crying!

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.640
Is that you crying?

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:43.550
Come out quickly!

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.010
I'm here! Don't be afraid!

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.570
Wu Yang!

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.560
-Wu Yang!
-Keep your voice down.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.250
That's not Wu Yang.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.020
Those are the cries of ghosts.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.670
The Great Buddha Hall's been like this
every night

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.920
for several months already.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.240
You should leave now.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.130
Wu Yang.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.360
Go.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:58.960
Wu Yang!

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.280
Come out!

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.630
Where are you, Wu Yang?

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.840
Wu Yang!

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.200
I know that's you crying.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.400
Please come home!

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.670
Wu Yang.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.030
Wu Yang!

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.280
I locked you safely in your room!

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.920
Why did you come out by yourself?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.670
Wu Yang.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880
Come home.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.030
Come home.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.550
Wu Yang...

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760
Xijun, come down.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.610
Don't worry, jump.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.830
Just close your eyes.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.400
Lu Lingfeng,

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.200
you have to catch me.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960
Yingtao, look.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.360
What does that mean?

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.000
That means Lu Lingfeng cares about Xijun.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:41.680
You...

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.030
Last night, when Chi Ying went out,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.150
she locked this room.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.400
But when the kidnappers broke the lock,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.800
they found no one inside.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.760
Later, they encountered Wu Yang
in the street.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.510
So Wu Yang could only have

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.510
jumped out through the window.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.840
From this height?

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.510
Wu Yang is like Xijun.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.840
She's never practiced martial arts.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.510
How did she jump down by herself?

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.030
So Lu Lingfeng asked Xijun to try it

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.590
to prove...

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.400
Someone helped Wu Yang.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.160
Exactly.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.530
But she doesn't have any friends.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.490
Who's there?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.360
Stop!

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.150
Still thieving at your age?

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.210
Come with me.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.280
You're good.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.920
I, Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.980
order you again...

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.320
stop right there!

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.880
Run. Keep running.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.910
Not running anymore?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.420
Let me capture him!

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.280
Wait!

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.550
Wanna beg for mercy?

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.960
No.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.070
I never fight with women!

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.480
Then I'll show you

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.460
how formidable a woman can be!

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.130
What are you doing?

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.110
He might not be a real thief.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.910
You don't need to strike to kill.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.630
Why are you still chasing me?

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.800
You're relentless!

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:55.710
Xijun, step back!

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.840
I'm not a thief.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.190
Not a thief?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.030
Then why are you running?

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.150
Chi Ying won't let me come to her house.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.230
Chi Ying?

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.360
-Good morning, Auntie Chi Ying.
-Good morning, Auntie Chi Ying.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.870
You've found Wu Yang?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.460
You've found my daughter?

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.110
No?

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.440
You...

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.400
Didn't you

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.880
crack that Cantian Tower case?

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.360
Didn't you subdue

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.670
some Demon Lord at Chengfo Temple?

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.150
And you can't even find my daughter?

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.550
What kind of disciples
of Master Di are you?

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.360
You're just a bunch of useless fools!

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.420
Watch your tongue!

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.230
When you've calmed down,

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.920
let's go to your skincare shop

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.710
and have a proper talk.
