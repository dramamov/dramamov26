(Chu Mansion)

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.150
It's all my fault.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.270
Today,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.710
they got accused

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.190
and insulted.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.950
It's all because of me.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.520
I never thought

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.120
it would turn out like this.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.360
I owe them an apology.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.710
My Lady,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.750
tomorrow, I will

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.960
have a new plaque made

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.190
for this family

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.520
and have the gate

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.540
repainted entirely.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.400
What do you say?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.520
How about

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.310
we track down the people

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.150
who spread rumors

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.990
and beat them up?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.430
Don't worry.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.840
I'm a member of this family.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.030
Gossip like that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.870
won't break me.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.560
I'll deal with this.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.910
I won't cause any more trouble.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.710
There's...

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.270
My Lady,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.240
there's one more thing.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.750
Young Marquis Wei was whipped

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.590
as punishment.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.430
My Lady.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.280
I always saw myself

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.960
as someone who'd follow her heart,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.520
no matter the cost,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.680
and no matter the dangers.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.750
But I never imagined

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.470
what I chose

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.910
would get so many people in trouble.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.240
All I know is that

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.470
you must be doing what's right.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.470
My Lady.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.480
I need some time alone.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.220
(Chu Mansion)

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.160
I know you blame me.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.040
Give me some time.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.000
What's your plan?

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480
To marry someone again,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.160
like last time?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.160
Linyang told you everything?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.590
I'm sorry.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.360
Jin.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.430
I still can't forgive you

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.040
for our family business.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.160
But before,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.430
I was wrong to blame you.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.000
A mistake is a mistake.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.270
I'm brave enough to apologize.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.270
Yu,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.520
I'm sorry.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.380
(Chu Mansion)

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.270
Don't worry.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.120
Wei Yun and I care for each other.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.430
But I would never

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.600
harm either his family

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.720
or our own.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.220
(Tablet of Wei Zhong,
Marquis of Zhenguo)

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.240
Do you know

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.390
(Chu Mansion)
what you'll have to face?

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.360
Do you know

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.120
how people will slander her?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.160
Well done!

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.950
What's the point of your doing this?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.360
What good is it to you?

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.270
Don't you understand?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.870
No matter how pure your love is,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.560
it will be considered dirty.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.680
(What can I do)

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.360
(to clear Chu Yu's name?)

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:22.060
(Tugu Temple)

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.460

(Song Wenchang, Chu Jin)

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
Why are you all here?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.750
We heard what happened to your family.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.600
Last night, Wenchang

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.030
guarded your gate all night.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.510
He didn't come back home

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.360
until all trouble was gone.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.600
It's not just us.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.630
Everyone is worried about Mrs. Wei.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.920
Look over there.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.360
Madams of the Wei family have come.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.320
And Young Marquis Wei.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.030
We're here today

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.080
for our family.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.150
I don't approve of your relationship.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.600
But I'll never allow any gossip

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.240
to tarnish the Wei's reputation.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.240
So many people are here for Ms. Chu Yu.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.240
You may rest assured.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.270
My sister is fabulous.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.270
I have nothing to worry about.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.440
Thank you.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.180

(Xie Jiu)

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.240
All our plates are up there together.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.480
(Wang Lan)
No matter what happens,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.080
we will face it together.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.360
Looks like the world

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.910
isn't as despicable

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.960
as we imagined.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.800
How is Yu doing?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.080
It's family business.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.200
Not to worry.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.630
If you had handled it properly,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.030
that wouldn't have happened yesterday.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.270
Young Master Sun met a hooded woman

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.790
in the restaurant.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.480
So, someone instigated him.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.670
Our guess isn't groundless.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.120
Ordinary people

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.270
couldn't easily make up

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.200
what was in that script.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.600
And it spread so fast

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.870
in Huajing City.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.480
They must have had a plan.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.480
Mr. Gu, I'll ask you one thing.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.360
Do you know

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.160
that woman?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.920
You suspect me?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.000
If I were behind all this,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.360
I would have killed you.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.510
Why would I make her sad?

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.510
Instead of making wild accusations,

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.750
why don't you find out

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.360
who the mastermind is?

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.910
If you can't handle this,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.720
then let go of her.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.510
Hope you aren't involved.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.080
What are you going to do?

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.150
To find out the mastermind.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.600
No need for you to bother.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.000
My men are working on it.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.550
If you can't protect her,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.120
I will get her

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.120
back to me.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.280
Don't forget.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.510
She's Mrs. Wei.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.510
You stand no chance.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.870
Are you sure

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.240
Guo Liu comes here

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.080
around this time?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.440
Rest assured.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.800
I monitored for days.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.840
He will come.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.990
Good luck.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.960
Thank you for that.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.840
There he is.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.870
That's him.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.360
Alright.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.320
Pack this up for me.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.570
No problem.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:38.960
Take it, please.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.250
Welcome back.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.450
Here's the money.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.290
Alright.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.870
Who are you?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920
Someone to catch you.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.240
Oh, it hurts.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.240
Be gentle, please.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.000
Let go.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.080
Chu Yu.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.560
My Lady?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.910
Why are you here?

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.030
To find the origin of the rumors.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.600
Or would he come to me?

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.790
What do you want?

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.120
To take you to court.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.630
Move.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.670
How dare you kidnap me

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.670
in broad daylight?

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.230
It hurts so much.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.240
That's Her Ladyship.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.750
Just like a warrior.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.960
Right?

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.200
She's Chu Yu, after all.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.820
(Court of Judicial Review)

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.700
What's that noise?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.000
What's going on here?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.920
What...

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.510
What is Mrs. Wei doing?

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.670
So, the rumors

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.630
are true.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.750
She's indeed a shrew.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.030
Chu Yu, Wei Yun.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.510
What do you think you're doing?

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.360
(Court of Judicial Review)
Why am I here?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.510
It's no use going

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.350
to court.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.030
Everyone knows the two of you

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.870
are intimate.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.240
You're taking revenge,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.080
trying to accuse me

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.960
and do me injustice!

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.480
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Spare me.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.840
I don't know anything.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.360
This case involves a lot.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.720
Your simple explanations

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.910
can't write it off.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.600
We've brought you here

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.000
just for justice.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.560
Get them in.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.990
Move.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.360
Move.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.630
I'm innocent.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.560
I always knew

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:37.840
Mrs. Wei would

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.270
cause trouble sooner or later.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.960
See? Before we knew it,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.510
she caused such big trouble.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.030
No wonder when I visited

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.600
Young Marquis Wei for a blind date,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.840
Mrs. Wei

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.680
wasn't nice to me.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.720
And she faked it there.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.040
Such a "good" woman

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.910
from the Chu family.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.750
Don't talk nonsense!

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.000
Chu Jin, you're such a fence-sitter.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.960
Usually, you complained a lot to us

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.840
about your sister.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.790
But now, you pretend you care about her.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.120
Shut up. That's my business.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.150
You can't slander her.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.080
Alright. Stop pulling her.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.600
I can't beat Chu Yu,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.480
but I can beat you.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.960
- Let go.
- You let go.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.870
I won't!

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.030
- Let go.
- You let go.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.630
Let go.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.970
- Let go of them.
- You let go!

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.600
You let go.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.590
Ji...

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.800
Jin?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.960
Mr. Song, come help us.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.960
(Oh no. Why is he around again?)

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.390
Jin, Jin.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.120
Are they bullying you?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.390
Mr. Song, can't you see

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.630
she's actually hitting us?

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440
They started it

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.360
by insulting my sister.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.920
I...

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.000
I've always been delicate.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.150
But they're weaker.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.720
Wait.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.030
We aren't in a relationship.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.960
Why am I explaining

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.800
this much?

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.630
Jin, this is your true color

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.510
when you defend her.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I like you even more.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.350
Easy for you to say.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.750
If you're with me now,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.680
you'll be slandered, too.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.520
I don't care.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.680
I got to know you

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.520
before those rumors.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.270
Let's go see the fun.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.310
I heard His Lordship

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.270
took Young Master Sun

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.230
and the storyteller

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.510
to the court for a trial.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.510
- Come with me.
- Hurry.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.880
Jin, let's go take a look.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.270
Come on. Let's go there.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.170
Let's take a look.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.310
She's indeed the woman I like.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.750
Jin, Jin.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.620
(Plaint, Plaintiff: Chu Yu)

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.260
(Chu Yu)

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.640
Make way, please.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.920
Excuse me.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.070
Come on. Make way, please.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.750
Jin, why is your sister here?

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.160
Mr. Gu, I hereby accuse Guo Liu

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.000
of selling and storytelling

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.750
the Romance of the Marquis.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.000
He spread rumors

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.920
to slander the Marquis of Zhenguo

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200
as well as me.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.000
Young Master Sun instigated some people

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.830
to splash ink at the gate of my mansion

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.480
to insult the martyrs of our country

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.680
as well as my family.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.080
Mr. Gu,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.520
please do me justice.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.000
Was she telling the truth?

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.350
My Lord,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.880
I'm innocent.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.240
You must answer properly.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.830
Mr. Gua asked

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.830
whether you did those things.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.590
What if I did?

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.310
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.110
My Lord,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680
you can't defend Mrs. Wei

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.200
just because

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.510
she was your sweetheart.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.640
The affair between the two of them

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.680
is obvious.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.550
Isn't it?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.350
- Yeah.
- That's right.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.030
We all know about that.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.790
Young Master Sun is right.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.880
Mrs. Wei and Mr. Gu

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.070
had a relationship.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.960
That's right.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.920
In that case,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.200
Mr. Gu will certainly defend her.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.350
This is ridiculous.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.440
My sister has nothing

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.550
to do with Mr. Gu.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.920
- I'll rip his lips
- Calm.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.030
and smash them.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.030
Jin, calm down.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.030
Why does she defend her?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.000
Since I've dared to come,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.680
I'm not afraid of being judged.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.000
Right here

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.960
in plain sight,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.070
if Mr. Gu

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.400
shows favoritism,

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.800
I will

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.200
accept my punishment.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.400
Why did Mr. Gu take off his hat?

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.780
(Fair and Incorruptible)

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.720
Please rest assured.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.640
If I neglect my duty

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.920
and do something unfair,

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.480
I'll take the blame upon myself

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.110
and step aside.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.280
Based on the plaint

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.790
from Mrs. Wei,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.420
the Romance of the Marquis

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.160
constitutes defamation and rumor.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.750
In that case,

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.350
the two of you

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.830
violated our law

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.870
of false accusation.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.790
50 flogging for each.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.040
The fine is 20 taels.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.830
20 floggings can kill a man.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.070
Not to mention 50.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.880
Mrs. Wei

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.720
and Your Lordship,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.350
the stories may be exaggerated.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.510
But do you dare to admit

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.160
that they aren't groundless?

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.680
If the two of you

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.520
are really innocent,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.000
why are your plates

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.920
up there together

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.270
in Tugu Temple?

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.960
Tugu Temple has been

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.830
a place for prayers.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.550
Anyone can hang

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.390
his plate there.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.110
I had it investigated.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.150
Up there,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.920
more plates have been hung,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.510
besides theirs.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.200
What if

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.510
only our plates are up there?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.680
Does that give you the right

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.550
to spread rumors

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.510
or tarnish my family's reputation?

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.310
What if I truly have feelings

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.520
for Wei Yun?

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.960
Is a woman only chaste

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.960
if she remains a widow her entire life

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.400
and stays loyal?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.200
If this is what makes a good woman,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400
I want nothing to do with it.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.510
I'm not a woman who relies on a man

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.440
or hides behind one.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.920
Even if you all criticize me,

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.200
I won't be scared.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.270
I'm responsible for what I do.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.240
But...

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.440
You took advantage of my family.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.880
A man like you

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.510
isn't even as courageous

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.350
as a woman like me.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.200
Jin,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.510
your sister is truly

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.560
one of a kind.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.760
Of course.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.240
Ms. Chu Yu has a point.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.150
Young Master Sun,

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.200
seeing is believing.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.240
Show us some evidence.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.080
That's right.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.070
You can't slander her
by making up stories.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.070
Mr. Gu,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.510
the world shouldn't be like this.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.880
Someone instigated me

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.200
to do such absurd things.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.240
That day, I only meant

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.790
to see some fun, My Lord.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.480
Just now, you sounded so confident.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.830
But now,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.030
Young Master Sun admitted

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.200
that he was instigated.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:33.390
Guo Liu,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.560
what about you?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.590
If you don't have evidence,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.310
the two of you

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.830
will be guilty of making trouble

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.270
and spreading rumors.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.870
Guards.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.110
Bring the rods.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960
Wait, wait.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.440
My Lord,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.920
I... I will confess.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.960
I indeed compiled

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.960
the Romance of the Marquis.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.510
But someone asked me to do that.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.590
Who?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.160
A few days ago,
after I finished working,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.790
a hooded woman

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.800
came to me.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.350
She said if I made up a story

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.720
about the two of them,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.720
she would give me 50 taels.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.440
My Lord,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.400
if you don't believe me,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.830
send someone to search my house.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.070
I didn't dare to spend the money.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.510
It's still under my bed.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.960
That woman was generous.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.270
Did you hear?

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.510
My sister is innocent.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.000
If you keep gossiping again,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.920
I'll even tear out

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.760
your tongues.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.750
- Exactly.
- Right.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.590
You just do it

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.540
and I'll back you up.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.430
Guo Liu.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.720
Did you see clearly

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.560
that woman's looks?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.240
I did.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.000
I remember the clothes she wore.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.310
The jade bracelet on her wrist

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.270
is of good quality.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.790
She's either rich or noble.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.960
Maybe

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.440
she's the concubine of some official.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.030
Or maybe

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.830
she's the maid of a noble lady.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.150
Guo Liu,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.790
you draw that storybook.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.310
Now, you must draw

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.630
whatever you remember

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.310
about that woman

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.110
to help with our investigation.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.030
Yes, yes. No problem, My Lord.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.020
(Court of Judicial Review)

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.200
The woman who urged me

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.160
was similarly dressed.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.590
Yes, yes. The same woman.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.270
My Lord, I've confessed everything.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.920
Please don't flog me.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.030
My Lord,

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.590
can I leave now?

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.640
Can I leave too?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.840
Leave?

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.510
Mr. Guo, do you think

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.790
you simply spread some rumors

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.440
which didn't harm any people

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.440
and that means you were kind enough?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.000
Young Master Sun,

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.440
do you feel aggrieved

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.480
because you think

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.440
you just did something

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.680
someone else instigated you to do?

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.520
Do you have any idea?

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.640
Rumors have thorns

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.510
even sharper than blades

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.350
on the battlefield.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.550
They kill people

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.310
as quickly, too.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.270
You're cowards, anyway.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.550
You only dared to hurt a woman.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.270
You called her "shameless".

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.520
Do you think

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.640
this can make terrible people

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.920
like you feel very proud?

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.590
Do you dare

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.880
to insult me, the Marquis?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.000
No, no, no.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.040
Guards.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.350
Put the two of them

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.680
into prison,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200
awaiting their flogging.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.160
- Spare me.
- Spare me.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.350
Mercy, My Lord.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.830
I beg for mercy, My Lord.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.960
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.630
Court is adjourned.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.500
(Fair Execution)

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.040
Come on.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.750
Let's leave.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.590
We should go.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.630
Thank you for today.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.950
Don't say that.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.510
Regardless of the reason,

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.920
I don't want to see or hear people

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.680
gossip about the two of you.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.590
You can think of it

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.650
as I'm benefiting myself.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.950
Let's go talk to her.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.960
It's Xiang who serves Her Highness.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.940
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.540
(Court of Judicial Review)
I'm Gu.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.640
We're working on a case.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.700
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.790
Greetings, Your Lordship,

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:31.750
My Lady,

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.590
and My Lord.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.550
Where's Her Highness?

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.740
I didn't see her all the way.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.560
All the followers are gone, too.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.720
For your information,

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.400
they all went to the villa

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.240
out of town to see the blooms.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:44.920
Wherever she went,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.760
she usually took you.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.800
This time,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.750
why did she leave you behind?

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.350
Her Highness ordered me

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.310
to do the cleaning here.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.720
I simply follow orders.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.870
I dare not doubt.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.950
Are you saying

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.510
you've been doing everything

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.720
under Her Highness's order?

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.160
I work for Her Highness.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.720
I certainly take her orders.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.920
Do you mean

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.590
it's also Her Highness who told you

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.750
to make up the stories

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.510
and spread rumors?

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.550
Your Lordship, I don't know

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.790
what you mean.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.760
This is the evidence.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.240
Do you still deny it?

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.680
Guo Liu sketched this woman.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.920
Dare you deny it?

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.200
Why did you spread rumors in town?

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.960
This bracelet is popular in town.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.240
This portrait is somewhat similar.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.720
How can you be sure it's me?

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.240
Why are you sure

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.440
that no one set this trap

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.700
- for me?
- My Lord.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.310
I found it under a bench.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.420
(Xiang is behind the assassination
and Yao Yong's rebellion.)

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.240
Take her away.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.720
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.280
Stop.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.310
Who is in the carriage?

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.560
The city is locked.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.680
No one can go out.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.720
Her Highness is feeling upset.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.200
So, she asked His Majesty

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.070
for an edict to leave the city.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.640
Let us pass now.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.180
(The Eldest Princess
has the privilege to leave the city.)

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.920
What?

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.840
Will you even

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.240
trap Her Highness in town?

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.110
How dare you?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.150
Let them pass.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:58.900
(Huajing City)

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.350
(The end is left uncertain.)

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.680
(I, Zhao Yue, will not give up.)

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:35.540
(Court of Judicial Review)

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.240
When Xiang was taken back,

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.270
she confessed it

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.400
even before she was tortured.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.550
She's a spy from North Qi

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.750
and Princess Yunyang's adopted daughter.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.790
The pattern

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.720
we found in the letters

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.910
is the code she used

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.950
for Yao Yong.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.200
She confessed to all those cases

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.440
where Yao Yong rebelled

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920
and Shen assassinated.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.920
But I don't think

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.680
she is the real mastermind.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.440
Indeed.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.040
It happened too suddenly,

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.920
as if someone had exposed her

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.550
just to divert attention.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.430
Indeed.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.390
However,

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.440
the clue obtained from Yao Yong,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.960
the evidence at Qinxi Valley,

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.400
and Her Highness's letter...

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.440
All these things

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.440
point to Xiang.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.550
She will be interrogated.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.240
Then, we will know

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.440
the truth.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.840
Chu Yu,

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.590
will you agree if I want

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.240
a private talk now?

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.240
Yun, you can go ahead.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.420
(Court of Judicial Review)

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.620
(Spring Breeze House)

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.640
Thank you

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.830
for helping me today.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.440
You were brave enough.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.750
I heard you had the divorce paper.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.240
Now, the rumors are gone.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.560
But they still hurt.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.430
Yu,

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.830
I have something to tell you.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.720
Wang Linlang and I are divorced.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.950
Now, I can finally

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:29.960
do what I want.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.430
Will you

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.520
marry me?

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.480
I carved this for you.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.070
I'm surprised to see it.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.750
But I thought

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.880
I made myself very clear to you.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.440
I just want to show you

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.200
how much you liked me.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.560
What if you forget?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.480
But now,

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.400
I won't like anyone.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.350
I can offer you a deal.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.750
You're working on North Qi spies.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.070
I believe you can see.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:58.750
In this matter,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.200
I do as well as Wei Yun.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.510
I have enough faith and evidence

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.960
for further investigation.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.560
Yu,

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.590
I will soon become

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.750
a third-grade minister.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.400
After some time,

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.600
I'll be head of civil officials.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480
In the court

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.110
or out of it,

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.550
I won't lose to Wen Yun.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.880
If he can't do something,

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.070
I can do it.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.480
If he can't find something,

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.710
I can find it for you.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.070
Now, the Crown Prince

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.550
relies a lot on me, too.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.670
You want to trade your marriage again?

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.510
Yes.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.550
You can think of it as a deal.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.150
But my feelings are true.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.880
You and Wei Yun

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.400
aren't a rightful couple.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.640
But now,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.920
I can protect you

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.760
in the rightful way.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.280
Even if you don't like me

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.590
as much as you did before,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.480
you should at least be good to yourself.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.120
Gu Chusheng,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.190
you really haven't changed a bit.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.200
Yu,

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.550
you can try to like me one more time.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.840
I've changed.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.590
Before, I did the wrong thing

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880
and broke your heart.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.960
But I'll make it up to you

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.030
for the rest of my life.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.960
I admitted my fault.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.630
I didn't have a choice then.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.190
But things are different now.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.510
You know better than me

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.150
if I'm your best choice.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.990
Can a woman

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.800
not live a happy life

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.360
unless she's married?

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.920
Must I

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.510
make a choice between you

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.360
and Wei Yun?

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.710
So, you still like him.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.280
Liking and choosing someone
are different things.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.960
And what happened today tells me

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.710
that I can choose neither.

Alright.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.110
You're back home.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.630
Now that you've heard

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.400
what I just said,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.030
I won't repeat it.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.440
It's getting late.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.990
Have a good rest.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.990
Tell me.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.360
What you just said to him

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.030
was not true, was it?

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.550
Not entirely.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.510
You said you wouldn't go back to him.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:39.910
But just now,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.880
you seriously considered

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.960
his proposal, right?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.440
And what did you mean

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.440
"I can choose neither?"

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.280
Wei Yun,

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:55.740
let me explain.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.800
Then, tell me the truth.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.110
The truth is...

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.760
You're very important to me.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.590
In my life,

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.440
you're the most important man,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.030
apart from my family.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.280
So, I don't allow any dirt on you

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.510
that comes from me.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.490
I don't care

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.550
how people insult me.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.880
But they're insulting

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.440
the military spirit of our families.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.960
That hurts me more

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.070
than abusing my body.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.510
I told you.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.440
When you're with me,

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.400
I'll handle the gossip thing

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.360
and solve all the problems.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.510
I mean every word I say.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.630
That's no lie.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.640
In that case,

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.400
you stand where you are.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.280
I will finish

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.510
the distance left.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.800
Alright?

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.760
Our great undertaking
isn't accomplished yet.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.710
How can we consider

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.920
this marriage thing?

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.030
Besides,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.840
so many people

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.800
are trying to make a big issue

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.360
with our relationship.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.440
I don't want you to get hurt,

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.880
my family to get insulted,

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.880
or your family to get criticized.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.070
There are many people I want to protect.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.990
So,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.230
I have to be selfish
when it comes to you.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.880
I don't need you to finish

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.190
the distance left.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.960
I just want you to be safe.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.440
Just stay where you are, safe and sound.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.760
Actually, it's not that

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.880
people love each other

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.880
only when they're together.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.360
And marriage isn't the only thing

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.280
to prove love.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.030
Our country is fragile now.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.150
If we insist on having a relationship,

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.150
there will only be more trouble.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.910
I believe.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320
You also want

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.320
to defeat North Qi armies

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.150
and expel them from Great Sui.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.120
Am I right?

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.510
I know.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.590
Before North Qi is defeated,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.360
we won't have national security.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.510
Our country is in distress.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:45.110
How can we be in the mood

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:46.150
of the love thing?

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.630
In case of a national emergency,

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.440
we're totally insignificant.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:00.910
So...

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.030
Wei Yun.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.430
You and I

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.590
will go back

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.280
where we used to be.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.390
Alright.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:33.430
I'll do what you say.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.120
Chu Yu.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.780
(Chu Mansion)

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:51.980
(Map of Fengling City)

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.060
(Fengling City)

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.880
General, why are you reading

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.920
the map of Fengling City?

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.880
It's the garrison of my family.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:26.670
I will request an order

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.630
to go and guard that city.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.510
Besides, the crossbow case happened

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.480
in Fengling City.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.280
There must be more clues there.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.670
But that city is desolate.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.550
It's far worse than the capital.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
If Ms. Chu Yu knows

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.070
you're going back there,

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.960
she will follow you.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.160
I've made up my mind.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.680
Don't try to stop me.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.760
As for Yu,

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.960
don't let her know.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.630
Now, rumors are everywhere in town.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.640
I don't think

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.510
she has time for this.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.880
General, with all due respect,

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.360
are you going back to Fengling City

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.280
simply for the crossbow case?

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.760
Do you also want to avoid Miss Song?

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.550
I see very clearly

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.630
that you have feelings for Miss Song.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.440
What I don't get is

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.110
why you're avoiding her.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.590
If one day,

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.960
I end up dead in battle like my father,

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.880
I couldn't bear to see Yu

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.150
take on so much

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.150
just to seek some truth.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.360
She can't even love

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.760
who she wants to love.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.240
Miss Song...

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.200
She's the rising sun.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.150
I have my own way to go.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.790
She and I shouldn't have even met.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.360
Only when I leave this city

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.400
will she forget me.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:10.350
Or...

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.800
I will forget her.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.800
Chu Shan,

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:22.510
start packing my things today.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:25.430
