=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.940
=Episode 8=

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.201
Miss Shen.

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:32.220
We'll cover the medical expenses.

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.520
You should'nt.

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:36.401
My brother didn't go to the hospital.

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.681
It's just a scrape, nothing serious.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:40.841
Glad to hear that.

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:43.401
Miss Shen.

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.201
Mingzhu.

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.880
But my mom is not doing well.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.561
You refused to reconnect with her.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.201
She's stopped eating
and can't sleep at night.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.160
She just wallows in sadness all day.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.201
Looks like she's about to fall ill.

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:04.720
If I do reconnect with her,

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:07.240
then it'll be my mom who gets sick.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.720
Mingzhu.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.801
I know our family owes you.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.841
But please, hear me out.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.681
It was...

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.081
My grandma was
the one who sent you away.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:20.521
My parents knew nothing.

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.281
They always thought when you were born,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.440
you didn't make it.

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:28.961
It wasn't until Grandma

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.920
was on her deathbed
that she told the truth.

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:32.841
My parents are worried sick.

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:34.121
They searched everywhere for you.

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:36.241
Mingzhu,

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:39.160
they're innocent.

00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.801
Then, who's guilty?

00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:50.001
That's not what I meant.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.760
What's done is done,

00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:54.241
we might as well let it be.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.841
My parents treat me very well.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.760
To me,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.241
they're my real parents.

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:02.200
Yes, you are right.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.561
Of course, we should
consider your parents' feelings.

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:05.600
It's just that...

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.200
Ever since you agreed
to teach Jiao piano,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.281
I could tell right away

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:17.361
that you have a heart of gold.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.961
I want to ask you for a favor.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.521
Even if you're just pretending,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.880
could you at least
give my mom a smile?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.720
Please?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.720
No.

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.001
I can't even fake a smile.

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.880
Whatever the reason was,

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:41.001
the fact is your family gave me away.

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.961
Did you ever raise me for even one day?

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.401
So why should I smile for you?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.640
I didn't mean it like that.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.801
When you see my mom,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.521
just nod your head,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.841
or say hello. Anything, really.

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.081
Just think of it as doing a good deed.

00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:09.561
My husband

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:11.241
tried to do a good deed, and he...

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.841
Mingzhu...

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.601
I don't have a choice either.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.080
Right now, you're
the only cure my mom's got.

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.241
So to you, I'm just a cure?

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.280
I'm still trying to find my own cure.

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.361
My husband's gone now.

00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:33.960
And I'm pregnant.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.921
I don't even know what to do.

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:39.350
I can't bring myself to give it up,

00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:41.561
but I'm scared to keep it.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.520
I'm terrified it's a cornual pregnancy,
that I'll hemorrhage.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.161
I'm scared
I won't be able to raise the baby.

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:49.880
I'm scared one day my child will
ask me where their dad is.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm drowning in lawsuits right now.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.001
And you're calling me a cure?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.080
Can I really heal anyone?

00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:57.121
Do I even have that power?

00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:01.320
I...

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.721
Mingzhu, I really do understand you.

00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:09.400
I know exactly what you're saying.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.440
I get it.

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:14.400
All of this

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.161
came at you so suddenly.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.520
And I also know that

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.200
bringing this up right now

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.121
is really bad timing.

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:25.241
But, ever since my parents
learned of your existence,

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.001
they can't eat, can't sleep.
They fight every single day.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.320
I...

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.520
There's one more thing.

00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:38.721
I need to apologize to you for it.

00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:40.041
That day at the precinct,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.361
I took a few strands of your hair.

00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:44.001
I didn't get your permission.

00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:45.001
I went ahead on my own

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:46.361
and did a DNA test.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.681
The result shows it.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.481
We really are sisters.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.520
You're our family's child.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.721
We're family, Mingzhu.

00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:55.241
Mingzhu, look at this.

You're back!

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.601
Zhixia, you're finally back!

00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:20.721
That test thing?

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.721
The paternity test?

00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:24.041
Did the results come out yet?

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:25.361
That fast? No way.

00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:26.840
Then, then...

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.840
How long does it usually take?

00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:30.320
Mom, don't worry.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.601
As soon as I get the results,

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:33.801
you'll be the first to know, okay?

00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:35.350
I'm starving. Come on.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.561
Zhidong, get me a bowl of rice.

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:37.200
- Quick.
- Alright.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.880
I'll make you some soup too.

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:42.400
Zhixia.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.561
They've both been
obsessed with that DNA test.

00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:47.760
They haven't even been eating.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.390
Like monks trying
to reach enlightenment.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.121
Oh, so you do know
they've stopped eating?

00:07:51.121 --> 00:07:53.200
And here you are,
stuffing your face, huh?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.721
Can't you care about them a little?

00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:56.121
I really was hungry.

00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:57.240
Since they aren't eating...

00:07:59.041 --> 00:07:59.840
Dad, what's wrong?

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:04.721
What's wrong, Dad?

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:06.561
Tell me the truth.

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.041
The results aren't out yet?

00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.200
No.

00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:10.400
Come here.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.681
Are you hiding it because you think

00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:14.880
your mom might overreact?

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.001
Don't be silly.

00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:18.161
Zhixia.

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.400
Your mom and I are not the same.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.001
I know we can't rush this.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.840
The last thing I want is to
reconnect with the wrong person again.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.361
Keep it secret.

(Supporting Yu Jingxiang

00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:51.321
Keep it secret.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.481
Whatever happens,
don't let Mom find out.

00:08:56.721 --> 00:08:58.800
You know
what kind of temper she has.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.160
I know.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.560
She's still sick,
still on medication.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.760
She can't handle any stress.

00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:03.040
Got it, got it.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.601
I'll keep it safe.

Can I trust you?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.560
You have my word.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.680
Now go eat.

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:20.321
Mom, are you done?

00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:28.601
Miss Shen.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:29.361
Thank you.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.680

told me about your situation.

I'll grab the paperwork.

Put on your slippers.

00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:25.601
Mom, we're back.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.880
Hi, Grandma!

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640
Braised chicken wings!

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.961
Put it down.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.160
Put it down, come on.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.961
That's right.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.760
Homework comes first.

00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:40.121
Never leave today's work for tomorrow.

00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:42.520
Go on, do your homework.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.241
You've got this.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.800
Zhang Hao.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.680
Let me tell you something.

00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:04.001
I don't mind
helping you cook once in a while,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.040
but that's not my job.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.361
I'm just here
to lend a hand temporarily.

00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:11.400
You and Zhixia

00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:13.481
need to take responsibility.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.361
Running your little family well

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.800
should be your top priority right now.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.721
Got it, got it.

00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:21.880
Do you really?

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.841
I know
I shouldn't have asked you to cook.

00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:25.081
I'm sorry.

00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:26.580
Just this once. It won't happen again.

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:28.650
What kind of attitude is that?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.680
My attitude?

00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:32.760
We're really grateful for your help.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.640
If you don't have the time,
that's fine too.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.520
But please,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.321
don't scold us while you're helping out.

00:12:37.321 --> 00:12:38.680
It just makes us feel stressed.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.001
Oh? So I'm wrong to criticize?

00:12:41.721 --> 00:12:42.880
Your wife is pregnant

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.361
and still running
to her mom's house every day.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.321
She's helping them with their so-called

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.201
"family issues from the past."

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.481
And what about her own home?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.601
Doesn't she care?

00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:54.560
Is that what a wife
and a mother should be?

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.940
Is that the example she's setting?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.961
You're back.

00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:11.601
Mom, thank you for all your help.

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:12.880
It's nothing.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.961
It must be tiring to be
running back and forth while pregnant.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.640
That's even tougher.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.760
- You must be...
- I'll wash my hands.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.481
I'm here to give you a hug.

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.140
It sure is hard on me.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.880
Hello, do you have a reservation?

00:13:38.001 --> 00:13:39.201
Yes, under Shen.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.241
Miss Shen?

00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:41.441
Yes.

00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:43.121
It's your birthday today, right?

00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:43.800
Happy birthday.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.201
Thank you.

00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:44.880
This way, please.

00:13:45.081 --> 00:13:45.841
Mom?

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.001
Sure.

00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:51.001
Okay, thank you.

00:13:51.441 --> 00:13:52.560
There's a little lamp too.

00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:56.241
So lovely.

00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:57.441
Indeed.

00:13:58.121 --> 00:13:58.680
Lovely.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.520
You can take a look at the menu first.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.441
Thank you.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.760
Oh my…

00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:04.400
Look.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.321
I already placed the order online.

00:14:06.321 --> 00:14:07.800
Just go with what I ordered.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.481
Sure.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.520
Please wait a moment.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.361
Sweetheart, let's not eat here.

00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:13.270
It's way too expensive.

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.400
One crab costs

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.800
a whopping 1,688 yuan!

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.760
I've already paid for it.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.880
Besides, it's not like
we come here often.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.400
It's just once a year.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.721
We're already here.

00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:26.321
It's my sister's birthday today.

00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:27.441
She's the boss tonight.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.721
We'll do as she says.

00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:29.961
Oh, come on.

00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:32.001
Do you know how much
she's spending on this?

00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:34.201
Mom, let me show you.

00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:37.721
Since I started working,

00:14:38.121 --> 00:14:39.961
I've been eating and living at home.

00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:41.601
I've managed to save quite a bit.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.601
See?

00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:48.040
This money was
meant for my wedding.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.481
I didn't get to use it.

00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:53.760
Are you that eager to splurge?

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.640
There's always
somewhere to spend money, right?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.441
It's fine.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.081
Jianqi recommended
this restaurant so many times.

00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:01.201
He always said he'd bring us here.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.361
He didn't get the chance,
so I'm doing it for him.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.841
Yeah.

00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:09.800
If only Jianqi were still here…

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.800
Don't bring that up now.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.640
Alright, I won't.

00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:17.481
Sweetheart,

00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:18.880
I'll say this again.

00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:21.680
If you really want to have this baby,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.241
even if the Feng family won't help,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.880
you've got us right here.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.040
Raising a baby

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.321
won't be a problem for us.

00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:28.121
Exactly.

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:31.241
My sister is the best.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.841
She's treating us to crab tonight!

00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:34.560
Eat up, okay?

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.800
Of course.
I'm eating until your paycheck's gone.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.760
Happy birthday to you.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.160
Zhidong.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.841
Mom.

00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:54.760
Happy birthday.

00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:57.121
Thanks, Mom.

00:15:57.121 --> 00:15:57.841
Zhidong,

00:15:58.361 --> 00:15:59.841
it's your birthday today.

00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:02.601
Mom made you a bowl
of longevity noodles.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.841
It smells great, right?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.001
A son's birthday is
a mother's day of hardship.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160
You've worked hard, Mom.

00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:20.241
Alright.
You're another year older now.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.280
Time to grow up a little.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.880
Get along well with Bichen, okay?

00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:27.560
We're doing great.

00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:28.721
Oh right,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.160
after you finish the noodles,

00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:31.560
you and Bichen

00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:33.601
are going out.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.481
Here, take this.

00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.280
Go have a nice meal together.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.520
It's okay, Mom. I've got money.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.961
No, this is from me.

00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:42.721
I've got money.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.640
- Hey.
- Listen to me.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.361
You don't have to.

00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:45.940
- You're always arguing.
- Hear me out.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.441
Chen's cultural center
has an event today.

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:51.001
She couldn't come with me.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.800
That's fine.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.841
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:56.481
But...

00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:58.640
We didn't even get you
a birthday cake or anything.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.760
This can't do.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.520
Xiang.

00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:06.040
Happy birthday, Zhidong.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.320
It's your birthday!

00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:09.161
Yeah.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.800
Happy birthday!

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.161
And you said you didn't get a cake.

00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:14.961
You surprised me!

00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:15.320
What...

00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:16.520
Thanks, Dad.

00:17:17.201 --> 00:17:18.040
Wait.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:20.921
Zhidong.

00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:22.721
This one's for your second sister.

00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:23.241
Right.

00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:26.161
Are you never home for your birthday?

00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:26.760
Yeah.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.600
You said you'd celebrate with Bichen.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.840
Happy birthday, Mr. Zhidong!

00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:33.600
Bichen's here!

00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:36.881
That's great! Wonderful!

00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:38.001
That's great.

00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:44.681
You're so mean! Why'd you lie to me?

00:17:44.681 --> 00:17:46.241
I just wanted to surprise you.

00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:47.721
I almost wanted to skip my birthday.

00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:48.441
You know that?

00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:50.241
An event at the cultural center?

00:17:50.241 --> 00:17:51.600
You're the worst!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.641
Bichen!

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.600
Bichen!

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.641
Mrs. Feng.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.560
Well, since you're here,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.641
let's stay home.

00:18:00.641 --> 00:18:02.420
We'll make a nice family dinner!

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:02.681
Yeah!

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:04.760
Let's celebrate Zhidong's birthday.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.120
- Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Feng!
- Sure!

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.760
Okay, I'll go prepare it.

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.760
Thanks, Mom.

00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:13.481
Hey, Dacheng!

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.721
Coming.

00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:17.681
Okay!

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:19.360
Alright, I'm coming.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.441
Hey, what do you think of these shoes?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.760
CR7!

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.001
CR7!

00:18:31.641 --> 00:18:33.320
CR7!

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.961
I saw you eyeing this pair for ages.

00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:37.080
Wait, you bought these?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.120
I can't bring myself

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.681
to play football in these.

00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:41.120
Wear them in your next game.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.800
No way.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.620
I'm framing them
and putting them on display!

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.201
- Here.
- This one tastes special, huh?

00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:46.840
Try the lobster.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.080
Thanks, Dad, I've got it.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.280
Eat more. This shrimp's good too.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.201
Okay.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.840
Mom,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.721
could you tone it down a bit?

00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:55.600
Your own son's sitting right here.

00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:57.441
Alright.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.800
Here.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.360
No food can stop you from talking.

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:03.001
Eat like a civilized person.

00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:05.241
Learn from your sister.
Look how proper she eats.

00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:07.320
Mom, that's genetics.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.401
You know exactly who I take after.

00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:11.520
Enough talking. Eat up, okay?

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.360
He's been studying so hard lately,
he needs brain food.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.320
Keep him nourished.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.441
You can have my piece.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.760
You're the best. Thanks, Zhixia!

00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:24.681
Today's Miss Shen's birthday.

00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:25.360
Our restaurant

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.260
has prepared a mousse cake
especially for you.

00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:28.201
Thank you.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.641
Thank you so much.

00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:30.360
That's so nice.

00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:31.520
Lovely.

00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:33.001
The candles.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.001
Right, thanks.

00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:34.760
Here, Zhixia.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.401
Put this on.

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.080
Okay.

00:19:38.401 --> 00:19:39.600
I'll light the candles.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.681
Come on, princess. Wear your crown.

00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:48.140
Let me put it on you, Zhixia.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.080
Give it to her first.

00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:53.001
How's that?

00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:53.560
Beautiful.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.401
Isn't it queens who wear crowns?

00:19:55.401 --> 00:19:57.560
My sister,
you're the queen of our family!

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.401
Queen? She's a princess!

00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:01.001
Here we go.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.481
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:08.721 --> 00:20:12.921
- I'm recording this.
- Happy birthday to you.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.120
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.360
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:25.721 --> 00:20:29.961
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.320
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.600
Look at this.
This is what a real family looks like.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.441
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:44.001
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:46.280
Hailu Restaurant? That's not cheap.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.161
Exactly.

00:20:47.721 --> 00:20:49.600
Look at how well they're living now.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.520
Why would she reconnect with my parents?

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.320
If it were me, I wouldn't either.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.560
You know,

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.600
her little brother is
actually pretty handsome.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.760
Almost as good-looking as me.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.961
I should send Zhidong some money.

00:21:03.441 --> 00:21:04.600
Why are you sending him money?

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.441
It's his birthday too!

00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:41.800
Dacheng.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.320
Dacheng, here.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.001
Take this with you.

00:21:45.201 --> 00:21:45.961
Here, take it.

00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:46.600
Okay.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.320
All set.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.280
Let's go.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.600
Go.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.280
Alright.

00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:56.161
Xu.

00:21:56.881 --> 00:21:58.560
Mrs. Xu, heading out again?

00:21:58.921 --> 00:22:00.001
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.320
Doing laundry?

00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:02.481
Yep, washing clothes.

00:22:11.441 --> 00:22:13.360
Once there's a daughter,
the son's forgotten.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.120
Morning.

00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:33.681
Morning.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.360
Shen.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.800
That family is here again.

00:23:03.481 --> 00:23:04.280
We're here.

00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:06.280
Here we are.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.441
Bring the cake.

00:23:13.481 --> 00:23:14.560
What's going on now?

00:23:15.001 --> 00:23:16.600
The whole family is coming this time?

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.800
You just won't stop, will you?

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.520
I...

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.560
Hey, Dacheng.

00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:22.080
And you are?

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.921
I'm Shen Mingzhu's father.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.441
My name's Shen Shengli.

00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:28.280
Mr. Shen.

00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:29.241
No need to be formal.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.401
Zhilu is...

00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:32.961
Zhilu?

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.360
It's Mingzhu.

00:23:35.481 --> 00:23:37.040
Yes. Her name is Mingzhu.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.481
Was Mingzhu

00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:40.441
a child you brought home

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.840
from Yujia Town Hospital?

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.120
Was it

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.201
an old lady

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.921
who handed the little girl over to you?

00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:54.201
That little girl of mine

00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:56.881
has a twin brother.

00:23:59.681 --> 00:24:01.360
Mr. Shen!

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.520
Alright, alright!

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.721
Stop crying outside our door.

00:24:04.721 --> 00:24:05.760
What's going on, Mom?

00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:07.980
That family's here again.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.001
- That old lady was my mom
- Why are they here again?

00:24:10.001 --> 00:24:10.681
Exactly.

00:24:10.961 --> 00:24:12.080
I'll go kick them out.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.520
No, wait.

00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:15.560
Let's see what they're doing first.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.360
Has your sister woken up?

00:24:17.441 --> 00:24:18.241
Not yet.

00:24:18.241 --> 00:24:19.100
Keep your voice down.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.760
I'm her father too. Her real father.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.800
So what?

00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:25.280
When the child was just born,

00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:26.881
you gave her away.

00:24:26.881 --> 00:24:27.401
No...

00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:28.721
Now that she's grown up,

00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:29.721
you want her back?

00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:30.520
No...

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.481
To be your caretaker?

00:24:31.481 --> 00:24:32.080
No.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.520
Aren't you asking too much?

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.681
She'll care for whoever raised her!

00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:36.280
Yes, yes.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.320
You can't just
grab some kid off the street,

00:24:38.681 --> 00:24:39.641
say she's yours,

00:24:39.641 --> 00:24:41.080
and take her home, right?

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.401
No.

00:24:41.401 --> 00:24:43.080
Are you out of your mind?

00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:44.161
What are you doing?

00:24:44.201 --> 00:24:46.040
What am I doing? You tell me!

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.001
No, Mr. Shen, hear me out.

00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:49.961
Please, don't take this the wrong way.

00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:52.001
We didn't mean it like that!

00:24:52.001 --> 00:24:53.241
Then what did you mean?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.921
You're making a scene.

00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:57.320
We just...

00:24:58.001 --> 00:25:00.401
Yesterday was her birthday.

00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:02.560
We bought a cake for the child.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.280
The most expensive one we could find.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.721
It's really the best.

00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:07.241
What, you think we can't afford a cake?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.201
No...

00:25:08.201 --> 00:25:09.800
You think we can't celebrate a birthday?

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.721
Of course you can.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.280
Yesterday was her birthday,
and today you brought a cake.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.600
What's that supposed to mean?

00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:16.681
Trying to make her
age faster or what?

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:19.201
We just wanted to show
a little love for the child.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.320
Mr. Shen.

00:25:20.881 --> 00:25:22.721
Can we please have a calm talk?

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.560
Dacheng.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.161
Haven't I already been calm?

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.881
What kind of "calm talk" do you want?

00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:29.681
What if I don't
want to talk to you at all?

00:25:29.681 --> 00:25:30.681
Mr. Shen, please.

00:25:30.681 --> 00:25:32.441
If we can talk properly, we will.

00:25:32.441 --> 00:25:33.360
If not,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.120
we'll come here every day until we do.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.280
Every day?

00:25:36.881 --> 00:25:38.750
So you just want to keep bothering me?

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.340
- No!
- Is that so?

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.760
Mr. Shen.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.840
Looking for a fight, huh?

00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:42.441
You want to throw down?

00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:42.921
Dacheng!

00:25:42.961 --> 00:25:43.681
Listen to me!

00:25:43.681 --> 00:25:44.950
- All of you, back inside!
- Don't...

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.241
Keep an eye on things.

00:25:46.241 --> 00:25:47.881
We can't all go down together.

00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:48.600
Dacheng, take this.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.881
Watch out, don't get blood on yourself.

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.280
Come on, let's step aside and talk.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:51.961
Dacheng!

00:25:51.961 --> 00:25:53.481
- You stay there!
- Step aside, huh?

00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:54.881
- Mr. Shen...
- Stay put.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.320
She is my wife!

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.441
I told them to stay put!

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.080
No, Dacheng.

00:26:20.441 --> 00:26:22.401
Come on then.
What do you want to do?

00:26:23.441 --> 00:26:24.241
Mr. Shen.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.320
I want to thank you and your wife

00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:29.001
for raising the girl so well.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.080
Let me bow to you.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.560
It's soft words
after the hard ones, huh?

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.280
Trying to soften me up?

00:26:43.241 --> 00:26:44.241
I, Shen Shengli,

00:26:44.241 --> 00:26:46.520
don't buy into this trick.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.681
Get up, get up!

00:26:47.681 --> 00:26:49.520
Come on, you're a grown man,
what's this for?

00:26:50.481 --> 00:26:51.881
Let me be straight with you.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.520
We didn't come here looking for trouble.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.080
All these years,

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.961
we've felt guilty toward our daughter.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.520
I...

00:26:59.721 --> 00:27:01.360
Please accept our token of appreciation.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.080
Take it back.

00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:03.950
What's the meaning of this?

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.120
We've raised Mingzhu
like our own daughter.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.040
And you hand me this?

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.560
What do you take us for?

00:27:11.241 --> 00:27:12.721
You've got it wrong, buddy.

00:27:13.241 --> 00:27:14.560
This bit of money is nothing

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.320
compared to the kindness

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.840
you've shown in raising her.

00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:20.401
When we heard
about the girl's situation,

00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:22.921
we were so worried,
but we couldn't help.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.441
She won't reconnect with us.

00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:25.760
We are strangers to her.

00:27:26.001 --> 00:27:27.600
We can't give this to her.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.560
This is for the girl,

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.241
maybe it'll help her a little.

00:27:32.961 --> 00:27:33.840
Please.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.560
You think money can buy back

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.161
thirty years of time?

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.120
No, it never can.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.080
Never.

00:28:00.921 --> 00:28:01.940
Here, I've got a lighter.

00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:03.641
Pal, let me light it for you.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.600
Thanks.

00:28:13.641 --> 00:28:14.681
Thirty years went by

00:28:15.921 --> 00:28:17.401
in the blink of an eye.

00:28:19.961 --> 00:28:22.241
I knew sooner or later
you'd come to us.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.241
This thing called blood ties,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.800
there's no controlling it.

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:30.241
That's right.

00:28:30.921 --> 00:28:32.201
Blood ties

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.600
are impossible

00:28:34.481 --> 00:28:35.441
to change.

00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:42.150
If she decides to reconnect with you,

00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:43.600
we can't stop her.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.641
If she doesn't want to,

00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:47.481
then there's nothing we can do.

00:28:47.481 --> 00:28:48.280
Right.

00:28:49.001 --> 00:28:50.080
This is something

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.080
that someday,
you'll have to give her yourselves.

00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:55.481
Pal.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.320
Pal.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.120
We both treat Shen Mingzhu
like our own daughter, don't we?

00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:04.001
Of course.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.040
The girl's in serious trouble now.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.161
You both know that.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.241
Don't rush it.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.520
Take it slow. Give her some time.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040
Hearing you say that

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.921
puts my mind at ease.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.560
My mother-in-law really has
a good eye for people.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.080
You and your wife are

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.881
great people.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.241
Honestly,

00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:29.441
Shen Mingzhu is my wife's whole world.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.280
She's terrified of losing Mingzhu.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:31.921
I understand.

00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:33.600
Anyway, we're on the same page now.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.641
From now on,
both families will look after her.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.641
Shen Mingzhu will be

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.441
the precious gem
of both our families.

00:29:38.441 --> 00:29:39.320
Listen,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.800
when it comes to women's matters,

00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:43.080
you've got to
work on their mindset slowly.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.520
Got it, understood.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.961
Alright.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.760
- Mr. Shen.
- Give me the clothes.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.481
Um...

00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:52.681
But the cake...

00:29:52.681 --> 00:29:53.560
Give me the clothes.

00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:54.800
But the cake...

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.840
Take it back.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.840
No...

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.220
Get on the bike. We're going home!

00:30:00.961 --> 00:30:01.760
Get on.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.921
Dad.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.520
Yeah?

00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:30.520
You didn't start a fight, right?

00:30:31.201 --> 00:30:32.921
What for?

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.241
They were in the wrong.

00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:35.881
I chased them off.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.600
See? I told you.

00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:39.360
The righteous shouldn't be afraid.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.460
I worried you'd get beaten up.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.560
Did you see how big he was?

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.800
Why would I lose to him?

00:30:44.161 --> 00:30:45.441
Back in my troupe, I was...

00:30:45.441 --> 00:30:47.840
I had some skill, you know.

00:30:48.161 --> 00:30:49.520
If he dares come again,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.800
I'll hit him again.

00:30:50.881 --> 00:30:52.481
If I really get physical...

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.320
No. Why would he come back again?

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.280
Are they coming back
every now and then?

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.001
But didn't you kick them out?

00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:02.120
Isn't it all settled?

00:31:02.241 --> 00:31:03.040
Hold on.

00:31:03.241 --> 00:31:06.120
Think about it. He's a grown man.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.080
If he wants to come,
can I really stop him?

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.721
Mingzhu...

00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:10.800
Why are you all standing here
early in the morning?

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.441
I was discussing with your mom

00:31:14.641 --> 00:31:17.241
about what noodles
I should make for you.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.881
Enough with the noodles.

00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:22.481
Just be honest with her.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.080
What's up?

00:31:28.401 --> 00:31:30.320
Well, your parents...

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.441
What parents?
What are you talking about?

00:31:34.881 --> 00:31:35.881
Your biological parents.

00:31:36.681 --> 00:31:38.360
The parents who abandoned you.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.881
They came here again.

00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:49.080
Let them come, then.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.360
We'll mind our own business.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.360
Come on, Mom.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.120
Yeah.

00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:55.800
Look at my girl.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.921
Blood ties don't beat
the ones who raised you.

00:31:58.921 --> 00:31:59.800
I'm telling you.

00:32:01.401 --> 00:32:03.201
I knew my girl had good sense.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.280
Here.

00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:12.161
Pickled greens.

00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:13.040
Don't spill them.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.441
Here, Zhixia.

00:32:18.441 --> 00:32:19.600
Shouldn't they be cold by now?

00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:22.520
They're fine.

00:32:25.921 --> 00:32:27.401
Here, Mom. Have a bun.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.760
I'll have a youtiao.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.161
Dad, you eat.

00:32:31.401 --> 00:32:32.001
Here.

00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:33.201
Thanks, Zhixia.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.600
Freshly steamed this morning.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.961
Try the filling. See how it is.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.161
This bun smells great.

00:32:48.001 --> 00:32:48.800
Mingzhu.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.921
You're an adult now.

00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:57.040
A lot has happened in the past.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.360
There are things...

00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:04.320
you have to figure out yourself.

00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:13.921
I only have one Dad and one Mom.

00:33:15.161 --> 00:33:16.120
And that's you.

00:33:21.241 --> 00:33:22.721
You'd better not abandon me.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.681
One Dad, one Mom.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.481
And what about me, Zhixia?

00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:30.520
I almost forgot you.

00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:32.280
And the best little brother too.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.881
That's more like it.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.001
Mother.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.921
From today on,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.921
let's call a halt
to the grudge between us.

00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:55.320
I never expected that

00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:58.001
the family
you found for that little girl

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.001
is remarkable.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.161
They've raised that little girl

00:34:02.201 --> 00:34:03.320
so wonderfully well.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.520
She's even better off than our own kids.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.161
That's true.

00:34:07.481 --> 00:34:08.361
Now,

00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:11.200
I've put the connection
in place with them.

00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:15.560
A bond will grow in time.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.080
There's plenty of time ahead.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.600
Alright, Mom.

00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:22.600
As you rest in peace,

00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:25.200
bless Zhilu so she'll be safe and sound.

00:34:25.441 --> 00:34:26.961
Superstition.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.481
While you're at it,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.401
bless Zhixia and Zhidong
to be safe and sound too.

00:34:32.401 --> 00:34:33.321
Yes.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.240
Okay, let's all bow three times.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.481
One bow.

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:41.001
- Second bow.
- My joss stick isn't lit.

00:34:41.001 --> 00:34:41.560
That won't work.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.520
Third bow. Done.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.520
Have a seat.

00:34:55.441 --> 00:34:56.401
Today

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.680
is a good day for our family.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.080
Yes, a good day.

00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:02.921
I never expected

00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:06.520
the Shen family
to be so magnanimous.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.321
I couldn't agree more.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.281
Zhidong, Zhixia,

00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:12.600
from now on,

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.761
you should repay
the kindness they've shown.

00:35:15.961 --> 00:35:16.640
Right?

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.281
Indeed.

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.240
Okay, Mom.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.801
It's only right to support your parents.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.881
But they raised your daughter,

00:35:24.881 --> 00:35:27.481
and now you expect
your kids to repay them?

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.441
That makes very little sense.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.700
- Of course...
- Xu Zhidong,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.560
if you promised,
then you're responsible.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.200
Alright?

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.120
Tomorrow,

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.640
bring gifts to show your gratitude.

00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:37.761
Gifts?

00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:38.801
Buy gifts?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.761
I don't have money.

00:35:39.761 --> 00:35:40.720
Mom, I'm broke.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.841
Wait a second.

00:35:41.841 --> 00:35:43.040
Let's not jump into that yet.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.600
Zhixia, how could you...

00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:49.120
What kind of attitude is that?

00:35:49.761 --> 00:35:51.921
Your dad put it beautifully.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.120
Today's a big day for our family.

00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:56.240
Right?

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:58.080
The Shen family has been so good to us.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.401
They have been
generous and understanding.

00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:01.640
They raised your sister

00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:04.281
from a tiny baby
to the woman she is now.

00:36:04.281 --> 00:36:05.600
And they did such a fine job.

00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:08.600
Shouldn't we be grateful to them?

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.401
Buying a gift is the least we can do.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.361
Right?

00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:13.560
Zhixia,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.281
you should treat them

00:36:15.281 --> 00:36:17.640
like your own parents
and take care of them.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.560
You're the eldest sister.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.720
You should set an example.

00:36:21.801 --> 00:36:24.600
You need to play a role model.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:24.961
Right, Zhixia?

00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:25.720
Am I wrong?

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.281
You can buy the gift.

00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:26.961
You're starting

00:36:26.961 --> 00:36:28.820
to sound more and more
like my mother-in-law.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.160
You turn everything
into some grand lecture.

00:36:31.281 --> 00:36:33.441
Why should I be
the role model you want?

00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.441
Just because I'm the eldest?

00:36:35.441 --> 00:36:36.281
Why me?

00:36:36.281 --> 00:36:37.361
Why should I suffer?

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.240
Just because I'm the oldest,
I have to suffer?

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.401
Alright, fine.

00:36:42.401 --> 00:36:44.600
I can't argue with you.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.321
You win.

00:36:45.321 --> 00:36:46.520
Just go home.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.560
Go back to your own home.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.401
I really can't count on her.

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.961
Fine, I'll leave. Okay?

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.881
You find me disappointing?

00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:55.841
Then don't expect
anything from me ever again.

00:36:55.841 --> 00:36:57.001
Count on your precious son.

00:36:57.001 --> 00:36:58.441
Count on that daughter

00:36:58.441 --> 00:36:59.600
who turned out better than us.

00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:01.160
Zhixia!

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.160
"Be a role model," really?

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.600
What are you people even thinking?

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.680
You're too worked up.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.040
A mother shouldn't have said that.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.801
I just...

00:37:08.321 --> 00:37:09.640
Zhixia's pregnant!

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.281
But...

00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:11.001
Zhixia!

00:37:11.001 --> 00:37:13.441
- I know she's pregnant!
- Zhixia!

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.841
Women get pregnant and have babies.

00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:17.881
It's it how it's supposed to be.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.481
What's the big deal?

00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:20.640
Zhixia!

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:34.841
Chen.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.841
Dong.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.001
I heard my parents arguing inside.

00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:40.190
They were asking why you haven't
discussed marriage with us.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.321
It's that bad?

00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:44.160
My parents have been busy

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.080
trying to reconnect
with my second sister.

00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:47.841
But that didn't work out,

00:37:48.281 --> 00:37:49.761
and now they are losing Zhixia too.

00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:52.560
Zhixia, slow down!

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.001
Slow down! Take it easy!

00:37:54.321 --> 00:37:56.040
Why are you walking so fast?

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.481
Didn't you all tell me to leave?

00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:58.040
I didn't...

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.160
Look at your mom, just look at her.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.200
Put this on.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.961
Even if you're mad,

00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:05.120
keep yourself warm.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.560
What if you catch a cold?

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.080
You're my child. I...

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.441
Can't I scold you a little?

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.321
You gave birth to me,

00:38:17.961 --> 00:38:19.881
so you should've raised me.

00:38:19.961 --> 00:38:21.120
Being my mom doesn't give you

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.560
the right to do whatever you want.

00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:25.560
She's absolutely right.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.441
Zhixia,

00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:28.921
your mom and I haven't
been thinking straight.

00:38:28.921 --> 00:38:30.001
We're confused.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.720
Don't take it to heart, okay?

00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:34.240
Let go.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.001
No.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.001
Let go. I'm getting my stuff.

00:38:37.321 --> 00:38:38.120
Let go of her.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.680
The doctor prescribed this
to help you sleep better.

00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:43.961
You'd better start being nicer to me.

00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:44.680
I...

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.080
And to you too.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200
That girl

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.600
always has something sharp to say.

00:38:56.361 --> 00:38:57.160
But still...

00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:01.361
She's my sweet little baby.

00:39:02.961 --> 00:39:04.200
That's what being family means.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.321
Nothing can take us apart.

00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:07.001
Yeah.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.001
Raising this girl was truly worth it.

00:39:14.761 --> 00:39:15.650
She's calmed down now.

00:39:20.281 --> 00:39:21.801
Chen just called.

00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:23.560
Her parents weren't too happy.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.720
Honestly, that's on me.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.200
We've been together for a while now,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.640
but the two families haven't met yet.

00:39:27.841 --> 00:39:28.640
Maybe you and Dad

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.600
should find a time to meet her parents.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.080
We really should meet them.

00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:38.720
But with everything
that's been going on lately

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080
in our family,

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.520
maybe we should wait a bit.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.060
Alright?

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.921
It's not something
that can be rushed anyway.

00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:45.720
- Yeah.
- Let's talk later.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.401
Yes.

00:39:46.401 --> 00:39:47.240
No need to rush.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:47.881
Yeah, take it easy.

00:39:47.881 --> 00:39:48.680
Be patient.

00:39:48.801 --> 00:39:50.080
Easy for you to say.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.350
I'm the one getting anxious here.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.761
Are you neglecting your own children

00:39:53.761 --> 00:39:55.120
for my long-lost sister?

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:04.921
Mingzhu.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.441
Meiqi, what brings you here?

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.841
Yeah.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.281
Have you had lunch yet?

00:40:11.281 --> 00:40:12.441
Yeah, I already ate.

00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:14.120
Um…

00:40:14.841 --> 00:40:16.761
My mom said
you haven't had bird's nest in days,

00:40:16.761 --> 00:40:18.100
so she asked me to bring you some.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.841
It's a special meal for pregnant women,

00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:21.160
all prepared and ready for you.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.040
Tell your mom
she really doesn't have to do this.

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:26.560
My appetite's been great lately.
I can eat anything.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.761
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:31.600
No, it's alright.

00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:33.720
Uh…

00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:36.120
Your parents aren't home?

00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:37.921
They're upstairs taking a nap.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.321
Mingzhu.

00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:46.001
I'd like to know

00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:48.841
if you'd be willing
to move back in.

00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:52.240
My brother's gone,

00:40:52.921 --> 00:40:54.560
and my dad's hardly ever home.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.680
It's just Mom and me now.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.001
The house feels so empty.

00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:02.080
I just feel more at ease
staying at my own place.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.160
I'm on leave right now,

00:41:04.441 --> 00:41:06.160
so I can help my parents out a bit.

00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:11.560
Is this about

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.240
the elevator card?

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.881
I've seen death.

00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:17.881
You think I'd care
about something that trivial?

00:41:18.921 --> 00:41:20.520
Go talk to Mrs. Feng when you get home.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.961
We've all got to try and live well.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.200
Only then can Jianqi rest in peace.

00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:27.240
It's not the same, Mingzhu.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.801
My mom lost her son.

00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:33.281
But, you and my brother

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.481
were only together
for a little over three years.

00:41:38.801 --> 00:41:40.640
What's that supposed to mean?

00:41:41.881 --> 00:41:43.801
Your brother was the father of my child.

00:41:43.961 --> 00:41:45.761
And you still haven't
decided to keep it.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.961
Are you here to bring tonics

00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:52.281
or to stir things up?

00:41:56.841 --> 00:41:57.640
Meiqi!

00:42:06.401 --> 00:42:07.200
What are you doing?

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.040
My sister's your sister-in-law,

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.600
and my nephew's your nephew.

00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:12.120
We're family.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.680
Stop acting like
you don't know us, okay?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.600
Who's family with you?

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.640
Your sister might not even
have that baby. Move!

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.361
Always acting so mean.

00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:24.281
Who'd ever marry you?

00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:31.160
Feng Meiqi.

00:42:33.361 --> 00:42:34.160
Well?

00:42:35.321 --> 00:42:36.680
Did she agree to keep the baby?

00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:38.640
No.
