[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 5]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.950
With a dose of gastrodia powder,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.450
my heart feels much more at peace.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.550
I've been plowing through memorials—

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.479
my shoulders...

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.790
Yin,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.930
how many years has it been
since we first met?

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.840
[Yin, Palace Maid]

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.560
It was

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.960
in the Eastern Capital that I first
had the honor of meeting Your Majesty,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.910
20 years ago.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.160
I was nine that year.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.710
I fell ill, gravely ill.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.630
My father was too preoccupied
to care for me.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.730
Had it not been for my aunt,
the Grand Princess, taking me in,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.280
I doubt I would have survived.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.540
Your Majesty, you were so thin back then.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.520
And you weren't

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.920
as slender as you are now—

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.140
you were chubby.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.400
In your arms,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.100
I always slept most soundly,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.040
never troubled by nightmares.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.340
I was young then.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.560
Now...

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.200
I've grown old.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.120
Back then,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.190
I was just a child.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.910
Now,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.890
I am the Emperor of the Tang Empire.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.690
What is the matter?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.640
Your Majesty,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.240
it concerns Lu Lingfeng.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.170
Lu Lingfeng has

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.000
mobilized troops without authorization,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.560
forced his way
into the imperial forbidden ground,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.240
and even taken imperial guards
into custody.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.170
This is treason.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.780
He must be executed.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.300
[Military Dispatch]

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.040
Your Majesty,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.590
someone from the Grand Princess's Mansion
has come,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.710
requesting an audience.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.640
The messenger is called Su Wuming.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.470
What kind of nobody is this Su Wuming?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.000
Why should His Majesty
grant him an audience?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.670
Let him enter.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.530
As you command, Your Majesty.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.500
I, Su Wuming,
pay my respects to Your Majesty.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.590
I thought you held an official post.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.560
Some kind of... scholar?

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.840
Criminal Investigation Scholar.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.470
The title was only for the raptor case.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.870
Now that the case is resolved,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.120
the position is void.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.750
So it's been solved, you say?

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.120
After a fashion.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.750
Who bred that raptor

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.360
to attack me

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.180
and injure the Grand General?

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.840
Who is behind this treason?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.840
Your Majesty, the truth is...

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.329
not easily summarized

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.480
in a few words.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.680
I come

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.680
at Her Highness's behest.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.830
Her Highness sent me to ask

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.560
if you have any
of those golden peaches left,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.940
the tribute from the Kang Kingdom?

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.790
Her supply is all gone.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.170
If you have any more,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.070
she requests that you send some to her.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.670
She—

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.920

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.070
-Guards! Quickly!
-Guards! Quickly!

Seize this Su Wuming and take him out!

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.909
Flog him to death!

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.310
Your Majesty,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.560
if I am to be executed, does this mean

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.630
Lu Lingfeng will be pardoned

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.690
for his unauthorized troop movement

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.159
and breach of
the imperial forbidden ground?

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.800
Wait!

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.070
Wait!

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.490
Bring him back.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.730
You came here, risking death,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.390
to save Lu Lingfeng?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.180
Death

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.090
holds no terror for me.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.640
If Your Majesty would permit me

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.510
to fully explain the entire story

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.480
behind the raptor case,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.310
then I, Su Wuming,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.840
would die a worthy death.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.310
Speak!

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.159
Your Majesty.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.200
Impressive martial prowess, General.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.920
May I test my skills against you
for a round or two?

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.770
You're injured, General?

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.120
A minor wound.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.159
And you are?

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.800
I am the former General
of the Imperial Guard,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.530
Lu Lingfeng.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.950
Greetings, General.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.210
What brings you to my camp?

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.240
By the Emperor's decree,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.870
I am tasked with attending to Lu Tong,
the Grand General.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.200
Now that General Li Feng

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.870
has been granted acting command
of the Imperial Guard,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.590
the Grand General is quite pleased.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.120
He has specifically sent me

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.440
to observe your camp's daily training.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.600
I see.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.240
Yet, I notice your camp seems...

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.830
Our battalion is stationed in the suburbs.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.000
We typically conduct drills
in the nearby hills,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.580
hence...

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.690
No wonder the camp appears deserted.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.780
Next time,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.090
send word ahead.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.520
My entire battalion

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.490
will be drawn up in formal welcome.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.510
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.180
What I said just now

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.710
was largely speculation—
it has not yet been substantiated.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.580
My aunt wanted the golden peaches,
did she not?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.130
She shall have them!

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.600
Bring these golden peaches back to her
and report your mission accomplished.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.659
I have no wish to lay eyes on you again.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.500
I am grateful for Your Majesty's mercy
in sparing my life.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.440
I will take my leave.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.160
Your Majesty.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.070
Your Majesty, this Su Wuming
is a cunning man,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.190
skilled in sophistry.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.680
Whatever he might have said,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.540
you must not take it at face value.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.630
The Emperor is certainly not stingy—

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.610
sending so many golden peaches once again.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.320
Chancellor Cui,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.240
you couldn't possibly have grown tired
of them already, could you?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.480
How could one ever tire

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.540
of such a delicacy?

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.830
Su Wuming,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.520
have you tried these golden peaches?

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.670
I have...

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.670
or perhaps I haven't.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.520
That is entirely for you to decide,
Your Highness.

To see the Retired Emperor.

What a gigantic bird!

It can't be that man-eating raptor,
can it?

General Li,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.670
why did you speak of "a new dynasty"?

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.200
Exactly!

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.510

Weren't we supporting
the Retired Emperor's restoration?

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.390
The Retired Emperor
is old, feeble, and incompetent!

He couldn't even
outmaneuver his own sister and son.

Can we truly rely on him?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.360
be founding heroes of this new era!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.950
What are you implying, Grand General?

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.790
Du Feng?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.000
That's right.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.340
From this day forward,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.670
there is no more Li Feng!

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.080
[Li Feng, General of Loyalty and Valor]

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.910
My ancestor

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.770
was the heroic Du Fuwei
of the late Sui Dynasty.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.720
[Du Feng, descendant of Du Fuwei]

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.250
For our service
in founding the Tang Dynasty,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.160
our family was granted
the imperial surname.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.120
Now I see

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.030
that surrendering to the Li family

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.320
was a mistake!

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
Today, in the glory of my ancestors,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.050
I restore my true name!

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.140
After this battle,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.960
when I, Du Feng, ascend the throne,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.480
you will be enshrined
in a new Lingyan Pavilion!

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.540
This... this is...

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.810
If any man here wishes
to deny this shared glory,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.750
speak now!

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.440
I, Zhu San, will never rebel!

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.590
We are already in the same boat!

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.270
All who hesitate
or harbor divided loyalties

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.470
will share this fate!

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.350
The Grand Princess is dead.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.290
At this moment,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.360
the Retired Emperor is at Chengqing Hall.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.230
The Emperor is on his way to see him.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.360
With my acting command
over the Right Imperial Guard,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.000
I have withdrawn all stationed guards

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.390
from the Chengqing Hall.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.320
The few remaining imperial guards

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.630
are no match for us.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.390
If we strike with full force,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.930
take them by surprise,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.160
and eliminate those two
from the Li family...

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.030
the empire

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.220
will belong to me, Du Feng!

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.500
Attack! Attack! Attack!

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.150
Attack!

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.720
Father,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.250
you may enjoy it without concern.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.200
Why?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.180
Did we not just receive news

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.000
that the raptor appeared

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.960
over the Grand Princess's Mansion,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.620
and her fate remains unknown?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.990
Was it

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.630
all caused by these golden peaches?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.440
Last time,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.750
did you also plan not to eat the peach?

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.790
Charge!

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.870
Forward! Advance! Press on!

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.870
[Chengqing Gate]

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.910
Break through this gate,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.040
and victory is ours!

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.200
Charge!

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.150
Charge!

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.400
Disaster! A terrible disaster!

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.320
Bad news, Your Imperial Majesty!

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.440
Bad news, Your Majesty!

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.600
A host of assassins in white

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.330
are storming the palace gates!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.080
A host of assassins?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.000
Their leader is General Li Feng...

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.190
no, no, no, I mean,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.030
the traitor Li Feng!

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.960
Charge!

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.810
Lu Lingfeng!

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.580
How did you get in here?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.480
[Lu Tong, Grand General]

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.630
Behold the token of the Grand General

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.230
of the Right Imperial Guard!

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.120
We knew of your rebellion in advance

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.790
and came specifically
to protect Their Majesties

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.410
and arrest you, traitor!

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.240
Arrest me?

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.770
Who do you think you are?

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.960
Better to become a ghost

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.550
beneath my phoenix-winged gold halberd!

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.220
Your ancestor Du Fuwei

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.390
used this very weapon,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.000
and most of the cavalry commanders

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.600
in your army wield it as well.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.560
That's why

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.670
when Su Wuming

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.670
was ambushed outside Weicheng Station,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.000
we suspected you!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.670
Soldiers!

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.390
I have just come

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.630
from your camp.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.840
I believe most of you

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.090
were deceived by this villain,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.840
not truly willing to rebel.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:44.710
Lay down your arms and repent now,

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.980
[Chengqing Hall]

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.630
and I will personally plead
with the Emperor

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.760
to spare your lives!

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.240
T-This...

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.620
Don't let him stall!

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.870
Finish this, now!

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.600
[Chengqing Hall]

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.200
Wu Wenbin,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.750
tear off that mask

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.960
and show your vile face!

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.850
You actually guessed it was me!

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.960
When the Paper Effigy Shop owner
was murdered,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.670
you forbade issuing wanted posters.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.930
After Cen Zhi's death,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.630
the Yongzhou Prefecture office
skipped the autopsy entirely.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.960
If I didn't suspect you,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.040
I'd be unworthy
of being Master Di's disciple!

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.890
How did you know I skipped the autopsy?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.150
[Chengqing Hall]

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.750
I served

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.150
as Yongzhou Judicial Official myself.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.440
Any coroner who examines a body

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.390
leaves a mark on the examination table.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.510
When I pretended to pay my respects
to Cen Zhi that day,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.160
I already knew

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.630
[Chengqing Hall]

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.120
you were

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.600
involved in this case!

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.750
The Amono man, Lie Na,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.960
once served as the Bird Slave
for the Deposed Queen Wei.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.880
Only someone

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.880
who frequented the Eastern Palace
in the past

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.609
could have known his identity.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.200
You, a clansman of the Empress Wu Zetian,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.550
actually incited and manipulated

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.609
your father-in-law into rebellion—

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.210
what crime do you deserve?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.480
Father-in-law,

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.430
pay no heed to his prattling!

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.069
We cannot afford to lose this opportunity—

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.270
we must strike swiftly and decisively!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.480
Lu Lingfeng,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.600
since you have no regard
for your own life,

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.030
then die!

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.650
[Chengqing Hall]

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.510
He who slays Lu Lingfeng

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.720
shall be enfeoffed
as a Marquis of Ten Thousand Households!

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.160
Charge!

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.900
Who is there defending us?

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.480
It's the former General
of the Imperial Guard,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.300
Lu Lingfeng!

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.500
He is outnumbered—

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.590
I fear Chengqing Hall cannot hold!

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.890
Bring me a blade!

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.490
Father, do not fear.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.530
If that traitor breaches these halls,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.200
I will

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.320
protect you personally!

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.590
Father,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.240
I trusted Li Feng too readily

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.430
and committed a grave error.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.680
But now I must ask you plainly, Father—

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.830
the raptor

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.640
was kept

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.480
at your villa on Mount Zhongnan—

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.980
were you aware of this?

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.950
How could such a thing be?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.550
The one who manipulated the Bird Slave

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.110
was Wu Wenbin, a clansman
of the Empress Wu Zetian.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.030
Though he held the post
of Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.550
he lacked the authority to withdraw

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.880
all the imperial guards stationed

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.680
at your villa on Mount Zhongnan!

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.510
Set him ablaze!

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.750
Charge!

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.750
[Chengqing Hall]

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:13.350
[Chengqing Hall]

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.460
You rebels!

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.860
I, Lu Tong, am here!

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.770
Lay down your arms at once!

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.750
Years ago, I had my own nephew

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.110
change his name

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.590
and enter the palace
as a palace attendant,

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.920
hoping to secure wealth
and status through him.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.850
How I regret ever listening to you!

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.570
Father-in-law,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.750
we are past the point of no return.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.080
We must fight to the end.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.450
Our only chance is to fight our way
into the palace

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.060
and take the Emperor hostage.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.040
Press the assault!

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:41.310
You!

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.300
Grand General,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.550
I, Wu Wenbin, have always been loyal
to the court!

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:00.440
All these years,

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.270
I have been undercover beside Li Feng,

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.030
gathering evidence

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.110
of his treason.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.160
Today,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.310
he has been coercing me all along,

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.510
leaving me no choice—

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.410
that's why I couldn't get the message out
in time!

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.740
Grand General,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.840
I am a clansman of the Empress Wu Zetian—

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.050
you must believe me!

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.030
[Chengqing Hall]

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.600
Lu Lingfeng, mark my words!

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.000
If such a man is not executed,
he will surely become a scourge!

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.550
Your Imperial Majesty, Your Majesty!

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.150
Speak now!

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.750
Great General Lu Tong has arrived
to protect Your Majesties!

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.010
The rebel leaders, Li Feng and Wu Wenbin,

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.350
have been executed!

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.070
Father,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.370
will you now answer

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.990
the question I asked earlier?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.160
Your Imperial Majesty,
General Li is willing

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
to go through fire and water for you,
even at the cost of his life!

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.120
Li Feng?

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.810
I believe I met him once
while I was still Prince of Xiang.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.300
Your Imperial Majesty,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.030
I, Li Feng,
have long been a talent unrecognized.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.400
Today,

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.710
I have finally found my true sovereign.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.460
From this day forward,

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.160
my life is yours to command.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.360
I would brave any danger,

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.880
endure any hardship, without hesitation!

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.510
Laifu.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.110
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.680
He served me in the past.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.110
It was then

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.440
that I entrusted him with the management

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.100
of my villa on Mount Zhongnan.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.200
Laifu?

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.600
I remember now.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.200
That day, he was drunk

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.260
and said his original surname was Du.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.470
You!

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.720
Stop right there!

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.170
Godfather, your heart is truly merciless!

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.200
Father,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.730
you have been

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.120
through an ordeal today.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.550
I am weary.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.810
From now on, I shall devote myself
to a tranquil retirement.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.060
I will no longer

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.510
involve myself

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.030
in any court affairs,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960
nor

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.590
appoint any officials.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.460
The entire Tang Empire...

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.400
is yours.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.620
To secure our future
in the Western Regions,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.510
I used the golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.570
to relay messages.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.520
I never imagined

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.270
others would exploit golden peaches

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.510
to stir up chaos.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.270
Du Ming,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.620
I know you are the Retired Emperor's man.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.550
Now that

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.550
he has stepped back from all affairs

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.590
and entrusted everything to me,

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.200
you...

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.920
I have always been a servant
of the Tang Empire.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.070
Loyalty to the Emperor

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.200
is my duty.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.920
Given the pressing need
for capable officials,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.480
I

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.720
will not hold you accountable
for your oversight.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.120
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.350
Henceforth,

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.830
you are my man then?

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.830
I, Du Ming, shall devote myself entirely
to Your Majesty's service.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.480
Rise.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.940
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.890
But what about Lie Na, the Bird Slave?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.770
How should we deal with him?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.880
Lu Tong was wounded by him

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.640
and lost an eye.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.720
I believe

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.960
we should hand him over
to the Grand General to decide his fate.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.350
If such a man

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.530
can be spared, he should be.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:22.630
Your Majesty,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.970
I was the vanguard

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.560
in the campaign to destroy Amono.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.620
But I later learned

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.920
the intelligence of their rebellion
against the Tang Empire

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.780
was falsified—

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.280
likely a stratagem of division

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.130
by our formidable enemies,
the Yenisei Kirghiz.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.440
If true,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.130
then losing this eye

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.150
was a price I deserved to pay.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.400
I beg Your Majesty

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.640
to grant this Little Prince

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.740
a chance at life.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.310
We're 30 li from the city.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.810
This should be far enough.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:06.960
Xue Huan.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.670
Why are you just standing there?

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.410
Go, fly!

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.640
Fly.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.230
I don't think the bird

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.840
seems so ferocious anymore.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:49.960
It's waiting for you.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.960
You should go too.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.480
You're

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.840
really letting me leave?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.030
The Tang Empire welcomes all streams
into its fold.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.720
Moreover, you have acknowledged
your faults, made amends,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.400
and assisted us
in exposing the conspirators.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.920
The Grand General also pleaded
for leniency

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.400
for you before the Emperor.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.000
Go.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.680
I...

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.560
I will never harm anyone again.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:16.520
My Flame Crow

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.680
will never injure anyone again.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.680
I believe you.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.070
You have suffered injustice in the past.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.030
I am

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.310
but an ordinary girl in the Tang Empire.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.200
I implore you, Little Prince,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.400
to let go of your hatred

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.330
and devote your heart to kindness.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.750
Well said, Xijun.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.550
I, Chu Yingtao,
also a girl in the Tang Empire,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.410
join this plea.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.320
Thank you.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.550
This face

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.240
originally belonged to someone
who committed grave evils.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.570
It should be destroyed.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:50.950
From now on, I, Lie Na,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.930
will show my true face to the world.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.210
That is entirely unnecessary.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.510
With this mask,

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.070
you can live a normal life.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.440
Wouldn't it be a pity to destroy it?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.030
Lie Na,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.830
I hope you will soon take a wife,
have children,

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.110
and live the rest of your days
free from worry.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.070
Thank you.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.440
Go.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.070
What a magnificent sight!

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.610
This is the true grandeur
of the Tang Empire.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Here, slowly now.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.800
Try a few steps.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.360
Alright.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.860
Mind the steps, the steps, the steps.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.760
Enough, enough, enough.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760
I'm done walking.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.440
Although I, Miracle Doctor Fei,
possess remarkable skill,

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.440
I am, after all, getting on in years.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.360
Best to rest and recuperate,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.710
lest I end up permanently disabled.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.510
A sound point.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.630
Xue Huan, bring the stool over.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.000
Okay.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.469
I overheard something just now—

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.000
that you solved a bizarre case,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.710
protected the Emperor,
performed a great service,

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.280
and the E-Emperor rewarded
golden peaches again.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.810
Correct.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.960
Six in total,

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400
one for each of us.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.270
X-Xue Huan,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.130
go quickly and bring them over.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.430
I'll pick the largest one to eat.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.510
Here, this...

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.800
this one is big.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:05.240
Mr. Fei,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.480
aren't you afraid the Flame Crow

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480
might fly back?

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.570
It's here!

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.300
I'll eat it first and worry later.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.880
How dare such petty villains

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.720
as Li Feng, Du Feng, and Wu Wenbin

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.590
disrupt the Tang Empire!

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.480
You speak truly, Your Highness.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.590
Su Wuming,

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.280
your stratagem was brilliantly executed.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.640
It was all thanks to you, Your Highness.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.560
Had you not played your part,

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.400
those hidden traitors

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.110
would not have been so easily exposed.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.030
My son has accomplished
yet another great deed,

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.330
single-handedly

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.000
saving the empire.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.920
I shall be watching to see

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.070
how they plan to reward his service.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.070
Lu Tong,

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.540
here to recommend Lu Lingfeng again?

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.550
I would brave any danger for Your Majesty

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:08.550
without hesitation.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.810
But having lost an eye,

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.310
I fear I might fail you

at a critical moment.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.190
Nonsense.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.880
With the Imperial Guard in your hands,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.880
I am most at ease.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:18.960
If Your Majesty

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.630
still has reservations about Lu Lingfeng

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.800
and is unwilling to appoint him
as Grand General,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.400
could you

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.950
at least restore him
to his former post as General?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.800
Your Majesty,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.460
only by employing Lu Lingfeng

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.070
can we ensure

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.320
he is not driven
into the Grand Princess's faction!

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.180
Grand General,

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.000
while His Majesty's position
may be delicate,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.030
surely he needs not

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.590
curry favor with Lu Lingfeng?

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.110
Attendant, you are mistaken.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.960
Lu Lingfeng originated
from the Imperial Guard.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.880
Now he has performed an extraordinary
service in protecting the Emperor.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.280
If we do not reward merit,

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.400
how can we command respect in the future?

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.480
But he is the Grand Princess's son—

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.510
this has been confirmed.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.960
What if he switches sides
at a critical moment,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.840
endangering His Majesty's safety...

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.900
Enough bickering.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.480
Regarding Lu Lingfeng's appointment,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.450
I have made my own decision.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.340
Where is he now?

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.630
Your Majesty's decree faithfully
and without fail.

The Grand General truly values talent

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.130
and spares no effort
in recommending the worthy.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.690
Attendant Yang,

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.800
instruct the Secretariat
to draft the edict promptly.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800
I will affix my imperial seal today.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.690

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.000
that I could not secure your return
to the Imperial Guard.

a position for you—

For his role in solving the raptor case,

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.370
Su Wuming has indeed earned merit.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.040
Have Lu Lingfeng inform him

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.110
that he may continue serving
as Criminal Investigation Scholar

a monthly salary?

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.840
Exactly!

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.630
The court has, in fact,

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.030
allocated a special fund

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.960

shall come
from your Judicial Office's budget.
