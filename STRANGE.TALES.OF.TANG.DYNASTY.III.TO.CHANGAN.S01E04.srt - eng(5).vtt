00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.210
How is it?

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.200
Any clues?

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.110
Have you seen him before?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.789
Never.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.380
Liu!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.440
Everyone, come look.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.740
Yingtao,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.030
is this a feather

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.160
from that creature?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.040
That's right.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.910
It was knocked off by my sleeve arrow.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.750
That makes sense.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.000
It's identical to the feather

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.860
that Fei found.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.360
But look at this.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.840
A leaf?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.030
The Ghost Market shouldn't have

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.090
such fresh leaves.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.120
That human-faced raptor must have

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.920
brought it from somewhere else.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.250
Xue Huan, take it off

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.530
and let me smell it.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.340
Just put it in my mouth.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.530
Sealwort?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.800
What is it?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.420
A kind of herb.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.630
Is it the one known as

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.960
Immortals' Leftovers?

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.270
That's right.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.080
But this one

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080
is no ordinary sealwort.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.680
It's an extremely rare variety.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.140
Around Chang'an,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.860
it only grows

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.980
high up on Mount Zhongnan.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.070
Mount Zhongnan?

[Mount Zhongnan]

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.000
Honestly,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.870
are you a human or a bird?

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.730
I see, I see.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.160
You're different from the one

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.230
that caught me.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.120
Eat up.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.670
This face doesn't belong to you.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.450
I remember the original owner's voice.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.000
The original owner?

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.000
You know him?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.120
Yes.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.130
He was an evil person.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.700
He...

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.550
I have no interest in his story.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.300
Save your energy.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.680
You were unconscious for a while.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.870
You must be thirsty.

Eat this golden peach.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.390
The taste is

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.540
very delicious.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.000
You want me to feed your bird?

people who have eaten golden peaches.

We've already figured that out.

You are indeed clever,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.820
worthy of being Master Di's disciple.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.560
You know me?

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.190
We've met once.

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:52.830
Where?

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.640
You don't remember anyway,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.480
so why should I tell you?

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.720
Back then, no one

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.950
would notice me.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.190
I was worse off than a dog.

since we're old acquaintances,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.430
why not let me go?

That's not possible.

I can't let you ruin my plans.

I won't give you food

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.600
or water.

quenches both thirst and hunger.

Three years ago,

I went to Mount Zhongnan with my father
for a spring outing.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.480
We climbed the North Peak
and overlooked the mountain.

The weather
was exceptionally good that day.

were clearly visible.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.740
His Majesty will never trust you.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.570
It might even

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.090
bring you deadly consequences.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.510
Return to the Grand General's Mansion
immediately.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.110
This case,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.020
no matter how far it progresses,

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.180
you pay no heed.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.750
Then, Grand General,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.680
please behead me

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.650
and say I'm going to rebel.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.320
You—

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.820
You think I dare not?

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.090
This sword

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.100
was given to me
by the people of Hanzhou Prefecture.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.800
They hoped I would use it

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.390
to eliminate evil

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.110
and establish merit.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.380
Now that I've returned to Chang'an,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.690
I've fallen into
a whirlpool of power struggles,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.390
becoming timid.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.630
Instead of living like a coward,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.080
I'd rather go straight to the underworld

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.440
and share three cups of wine
with Guo Zhuang!

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:57.790
You—

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.690
You bastard.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.750
Get up.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.810
Get up!

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.780
It's not that I don't want to help you.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.660
Even as the Grand General,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.550
I don't have the authority

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.540
to search imperial villas.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.840
Of those three residences,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.090
one belongs to the Emperor,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.690
one belongs to the Princess,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.750
and one of highest altitude

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.550
belongs to the Retired Emperor.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.880
How can we search them?

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.030
Ji,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.120
it's so late.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.790
What brings you here?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.670
I'm sorry for disturbing your rest.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.150
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.870
Nonsense.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.730
Getting a visit from my son

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.030
makes me happy.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.840
Alright,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.360
when I heard you came
in the middle of the night,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.160
I already knew why.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.320
That senior brother of yours

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.150
was trained by Di Renjie himself,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.550
but he was careless this time

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.150
and got taken by that raptor.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.390
You want an official position

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.150
to legitimately investigate this case

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.370
and rescue Su Wuming.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.680
First thing tomorrow morning,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.600
I'll go see the Retired Emperor.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.120
The Court of Judicial Review
or Yongzhou Prefecture?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.380
Where do you want to go?

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.830
To rescue Su Wuming,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.060
I need no official position.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.720
I just ask for your permission

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.160
to search your villa on Mount Zhongnan.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.760
What do you mean by that?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.160
That raptor is extremely large.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.500
It can't easily hide within Chang'an

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.650
and there are clues
pointing to Mount Zhongnan.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.030
Therefore...

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.200
Are you suspecting me?

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.280
Suspecting that I'm the one

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.840
raising that raptor?

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.480
Other than the imperial forbidden grounds,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.410
all other places

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.590
have been thoroughly searched.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.260
The imperial forbidden grounds

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.340
don't just include my villa.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.800
Why don't you suspect His Majesty

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.680
or the Retired Emperor?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.790
Just because His Majesty
ate the golden peach

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.720
and was attacked by the raptor,

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.600
while I

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.500
ate the golden peach
and remained unharmed?

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.140
So you also believe those

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.780
baseless rumors

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.060
and suspect your own mother?

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.720
Yes.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.490
That man is the one
sitting on the throne now.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.080
You want to achieve merit

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.480
and show your loyalty.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.610
I understand.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.670
But

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.670
for you to suspect

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.930
that I would use such despicable means,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.270
you are insulting me

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.610
and belittling me.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.630
Lu Lingfeng,

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.910
you've broken your mother's heart.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.520
Leave.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.600
Leave right now.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.630
Don't wait for me

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.800
to have someone drive you out!

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.150
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:19.910
General,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.250
having a drink?

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.120
Go ahead.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:22.800
What is it?

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.020
A few days ago in Chang'an County,

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.870
a Paper Effigy Shop's owner was killed.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.510
The murderer

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.840
was likely his assistant.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.910
We looked at Miss Pei's drawing

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.570
of that bird-man

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.030
and thought it resembled

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.870
the Paper Effigy Shop's assistant

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.530
as described by the landlord.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.300
What?

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.000
Do you think this could be

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.700
a lead?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:39.960
Luo and Jia

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.910
have already gone to find the landlord.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.550
Take me there quickly.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.910
Yes.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.200
This...

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.750
Why does he have wings?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.260
Could he be some kind of demon?

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.090
Don't look elsewhere.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.200
Both of you,
just look carefully at the face.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.060
Is this the man?

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:03.890
Yes,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.510
it's him.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.040
It's him.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.240
Sorry to disturb you so late.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.840
Thank you both for your help.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.390
This is a murder case.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.790
Why was the investigation
done so carelessly?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.840
None of us three were on duty that day.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.840
Somehow,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.600
Official Wu got involved.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.290
Think about it.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.480
The Judicial Official
of Yongzhou Prefecture

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.940
personally investigated this case.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.600
Who in Chang'an County would dare
to overstep and reinvestigate?

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.930
Wu Wenbin.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.620
This Judicial Official

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.620
is quite skilled.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.390
That day, Su Wuming and I

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.360
rushed to Yongzhou Prefecture overnight.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.790
In less than two hours,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.380
his undercover agents

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.020
located the Ever-changing Master

at his hideout in the Ghost Market.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.300
His surname is Wu

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.970
and holds such an important position
at his young age.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.100
Could he Empress Wu Zetian's relative?

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.030
My father mentioned his name before.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.840
Wu Wenbin,

Empress Wu Zetian's relative.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.550
I believe

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.160
he's also some general's son-in-law.

a thorough search

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.550
but still couldn't find

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.079
Scholar Su's whereabouts.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.359
I'm also extremely anxious about this.

Thank you, Official Wu.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.740
for 16 hours.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.350
The evidence we have

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.300
is very limited.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.360
I'm willing to trust Fei.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.790
I bet that raptor is in Mount Zhongnan.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.590
I have a plan,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:31.750
but it's risky.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.970
Therefore,

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.210
Nothing.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.750

to enter this place?

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.510

and find Su Wuming,

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.710

including you.

But even if the raptor

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.590
is kept in the Princess's villa,

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.560
it doesn't prove

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.410
that the attack on His Majesty

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.740
was under your orders.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.590

to solve this mysterious case.

It's rare to see the Princess

But what should we do next?

No need.

And wine too.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.880

they still show past grandeur

It must be an imperial villa.

During Emperor Gaozong's reign,

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.640
west of the Western Region
was a country called Amono.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.240
The Tang Empire destroyed it

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.550
for provoking and invading our borders.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.310
At that time, the Little Prince Lie Na

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.920
was just a small child.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.200
He was taken to Chang'an

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:01.880
and became a slave.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.830
Deposed Queen Wei had just become
the Crown Princess then.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.350
She loved birds.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.550
Knowing Amono was the kingdom of birds,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.570
she had the Little Prince
tend to her birds.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.850
She wouldn't allow him

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.000
to show his real face,

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.680
so she ordered craftsmen

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.480
to make a bird-shaped mask

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.400
and forcibly

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.590
put it on his face.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.790
As the Little Prince grew up,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.590
his facial structure

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.400
took on the shape of a bird.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.050
Everyone called him

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.880
the Bird Slave.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.850
Years later,

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.400
when Emperor Zhongzong
returned to the Eastern Palace,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.960
Master Di was already elderly.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.530
He had limited mobility

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.590
and needed accompaniment

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.870
wherever he went.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:05.510
So,

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.710
when my mentor visited the Eastern Palace,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.520
I had the honor to accompany him.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.030
In the courtyard,

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.650
I personally witnessed

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.330
the Bird Slave
being tortured by Deposed Queen Wei

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.420
for making a mistake.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.550
That scene

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.630
remains unforgettable to this day.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.270
I never expected

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.980
you would remember me.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.750
You said we had met before,

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.910
and this case involves a bird-man.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.920
I instantly thought of you

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.030
because the impression you left on me

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.640
was truly profound.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.750
I never expected there to be such a past.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.480
Let me ask you.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.170
How can he Flame Crow you raised

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.970
specifically attack those
who ate the peaches?

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:54.750
Six years ago,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.450
I was able to return to Amono,

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.630
but my homeland had changed,

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.310
making it difficult to restore my country.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.000
What saddened me more

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.440
was that our Flame Crows
had almost gone extinct.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.850
One day,

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.070
when I had nothing left

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.400
but a piece of hardtack,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.060
I suddenly discovered

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.400
a young Flame Crow in the grass.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.700
I used that piece of hardtack to nurse it

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.820
back to life.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.030
It stayed with me

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.920
and became

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.000
my only friend.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.750
Later, I heard
that the neighboring Kang Kingdom

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.110
was resuming their tribute
of golden peaches to the Tang Empire.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.970
Thus, I had an idea.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.710
You used the golden peaches

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.860
to feed animals on the grassland,

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.230
then trained the Flame Crow

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.000
to hunt those animals?

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.440
The Flame Crow

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.180
is the fiercest bird on the grasslands.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.350
It also has the keenest sense of smell.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.050
But I didn't train it

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.070
using animals.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.720
I used those who'd betrayed

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.280
Amono

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.770
as hunting targets.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.880
First, I'd send them
the precious golden peaches from Kang,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.940
then have the Flame Crow attack them,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.510
carry them high into the air,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.170
and drop them repeatedly.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.880
When they were nothing but bloody pulp,

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.679
it would tear open their chests.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.030
After years of this,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.940
I finally finished training
the Flame Crow.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.840
I also received financial support
from former officials

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.280
and found the former imperial advisor

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.830
of Amono.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.820
He helped me use the collected feathers

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.630
to make

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.480
an even larger pair of wings.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.170
With added mechanisms,

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.670
it was capable of swift flight.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.520
Everything was ready,

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.270
so I returned to Chang'an.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.760
You attacked His Majesty

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.929
to take revenge on the Tang Empire.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.190
Only after returning to Chang'an
did I learn

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.450
that Deposed Queen Wei has already died.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.840
I was furious—

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.590
furious that I couldn't take revenge
with my own hands!

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.960
But the current Emperor

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.840
is not the one who harmed you.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.040
They're all the same!

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.390
They're from the same family!

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.550
Why doesn't your bird

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.350
attack the Princess's Mansion?

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.930
That's because

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.880
the Princess showed him kindness before.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.290
How did you guess that too?

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.110
I didn't guess.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.340
The Princess told me.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.570
That raptor truly wasn't raised by you?

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:37.840
Su Wuming!

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.480
Kneel down right now!

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.230
Even if I die kneeling here,

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.030
I must get to the bottom of this.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.690
Otherwise,

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.270
this mysterious case cannot be solved.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:57.090
[Qingxin Pavilion]

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.620
After eating the golden peach
from the Kang Kingdom,

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.680
do not leave the Princess's Mansion.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.470
Who else knows about this?

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840
Just the two of us.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.440
That bird was too strange.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.560
We took the liberty

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.480
of reporting directly to Your Highness.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.400
Well done.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.630
This matter

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.090
must not be told to anyone,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.530
including Cen Zhi.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.190
Yes.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.590
If the Princess hadn't shown you kindness,

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.150
why would you have given a warning first?

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.360
Indeed.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.190
That year, I accidentally killed

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.450
a parrot.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.550
Deposed Queen Wei was about to

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.260
cut out my tongue.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.630
The Princess happened to be in the palace.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.720
She spoke up for me

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.760
and took me away.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.190
I heard you're a prince of Amono.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.070
You've suffered all these years.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.010
I'll have your slave status removed.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.630
You are free now.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.450
I must certainly repay

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:10.180
the Princess for her kindness!

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.400
Knowing to repay kindness

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.830
means he's not beyond redemption.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.290
Who are your accomplices?

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.150
Who ordered you to do this?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.760
No one.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.110
You attempted to assassinate His Majesty.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:20.920
Grand General Lu Tong

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.250
injured his eye as well.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.840
The Tang Empire's miracle doctor

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.360
was nearly killed in a fall.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.000
Tell me,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.630
which of these isn't a serious crime?

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.830
Just kill me quickly and be done with it.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.640
I'll go kill that bird first

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.530
to avenge Mr. Fei.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.000
No!

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.920
Please don't!

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.660
Kill me first.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.750
Kill me first, please!

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.350
Don't!

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.670
Such deep affection

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.370
for a bird.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.230
You can't be a bad person.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.510
I'm guessing

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.360
that after you came to Chang'an,

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.030
and heard Deposed Queen Wei has died,

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.110
you abandoned your evil intentions.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.710
You...

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.630
Stop making wild guesses.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.990
Seems I guessed right again.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.590
All of you, leave first.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.070
Go.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.490
Lie Na,

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.110
do you know

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:29.900
who that heroic person was?

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.100
How would I know?

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.400
He is the Princess's son.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.980
If you don't reveal
your accomplices today,

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.030
we will all be implicated

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.320
and lose our lives.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.630
Including

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.630
the Princess's son.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.000
You must have accomplices.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.980
Otherwise, how could you

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.360
hide in the Retired Emperor's villa?

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.630
Yes.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:59.110
I returned to Chang'an

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.350
and learned Deposed Queen Wei has dead.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.410
I wanted to make a living in Chang'an,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.940
but because of my bird-like face,

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.670
I suffered great humiliation.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.670
Eventually, I bought

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.830
this face that I liked
in the Ghost Market,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.020
which gave me my current appearance.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.840
Unexpectedly...

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.030
Are you satisfied?

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.810
Thank you, Ever-changing Master.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:43.320
I heard you have a strange bird.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.190
Who are you?

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.810
And you can fly too.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.230
You've been following me.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.510
Respected Prince of Amono,

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.530
I can help you achieve

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.050
everything you desire.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.190
He actually knew my identity

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.230
and told me about the golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.000
were about to enter the capital.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.280
He wanted to work with me

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.150
to assassinate His Majesty, the Princess,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.440
and the Retired Emperor.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.150
After succeeding, he'll help me
restore my kingdom.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.750
Of course,

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:19.960
I've already decided

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.150
not to harm the princess,

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.760
so I designated the Princess's Mansion

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.560
as a place where the Flame Crow
is forbidden to fly.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.320
Do you know that person's identity?

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.660
He always wears a mask.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.710
How did you get to

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.960
the Retired Emperor's villa?

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.710
I flew there.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.190
After you flew there,

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.520
did you see anyone else?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.890
The villa was always empty.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.970
Completely empty?

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.100
The Retired Emperor's villa
on Mount Zhongnan

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.940
should be heavily guarded,

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.630
yet all guards were removed.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.190
Thinking about it carefully,

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.590
it's terrifying.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.880
The masked man who incited

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.010
Little Prince Lie Na

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.320
must be someone extraordinary.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.220
Someone who could recognize a Bird Slave

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:21.840
must have

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.230
frequently visited

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.630
the Eastern Palace
when Emperor Zhongzong was Crown Prince.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.300
The most likely candidate

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.520
would be from
the Li and Wu imperial clans.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:41.230
