00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.850
I was originally from Leshou, Yingzhou.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.400
Ever since I was a child,
I've traveled everywhere

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
with my father's lion dance troupe.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.430

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.810
and he was my father's
most valued disciple.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.560
We were childhood sweethearts
who grew up together.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.090
Back in the Divine Capital,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.150
no one could rival us—
the husband-and-wife team—

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.750
when we performed together.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.710
We even defeated

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.050
the lion dance troupe personally assembled
by the Chancellor,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.680
securing first place at that year's

Capital's Lion Dance Competition.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.870
But who could've guessed?
The Chancellor we defeated

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
was Empress Wu Zetian's own nephew—

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.750
a man so petty,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.150
he framed us

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.360
for using the lion dance
as a cover for assassination.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120
To protect us, my father

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.200
took the blame for everything…

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.030
and died unjustly in prison.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.710
At that time,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.870
I truly wanted
to follow my father in death—

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.470
but I was

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.470
with child for the first time

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.660
in my thirty-seven years of life.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.520
Wu Yang's father told me
to go to Chang'an first.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.470
He said

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750
he would stay behind
to settle Father's affairs,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.750
and then come to Chang'an to find me.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.660
But not long after I arrived in Chang'an,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.360
news broke

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.410
of a major incident
in the Divine Capital:

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.470
a lion dancer

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.360
attempted to assassinate the Chancellor
in broad daylight

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.360
and was cut down.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.770
In that moment,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.630
I knew—

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.910
Wu Yang

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.329
would never see her father again.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.280
He knew it was a hopeless fight,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.829
yet he charged ahead
without looking back.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.870
He sent me away on purpose…

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.120
so he could avenge my father himself.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.910
How can you be sure

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.630
the assassin was your husband?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.430
It was because
I received his last letter.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.120
He told me

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.670
to lift my head

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.640
and keep moving forward.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.590

find a father for our unborn child,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910
then the child could take his surname.

If not for Wu Yang,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.430
I would never

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.240

I did go.

Even if I had no desire to remarry,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.620

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.940
My apologies, I didn't mean to...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.790
Seeing you

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.150
reminded me of someone
I once knew—

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.950
so much so that I lost my footing.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.090
You look just like that person.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.150
Who?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.150
An old love of mine.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.910
Who are you,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.090
and what do you want?

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.370
Wu Yang.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:09:59.960
Mother.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.920
If a wandering hermit

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.030
said something like that to Wu Yang,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.750
it can't mean anything good.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.440
Did Wu Yang tell you

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.840
what the hermit said?

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.840
Wu Yang is an obedient girl.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.550
She tells me everything.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.630
Xijun,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.320
based on Chi Ying's description,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.870
sketch a portrait
of that wandering hermit.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.320
On it.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.270
Officer,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.440
please don't blame Chi Ying.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.000
Any mother

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.720
would be frantic

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.420
having lost her daughter.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.170
Understood.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.800
You may go.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.440
Yes.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.160
Xue Huan,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.280
see them out.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.150
Something's happened!

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.350
Come inside quickly!

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.900
It's him! Exactly.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.150
The more you draw,
the more it looks like him.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.010
That's the man!

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.300
What happened?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.870
-Look at the portrait!
-Look!

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.150
It's incredibly lifelike!

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.030
Incredible!

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.130
You have a portrait of him?

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.680
It's the same person.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.960
Only...

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.610
I can't quite tell his age.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.170
Auntie Chi Ying,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.150
this man—though his hair
and beard are white—

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.010
has a youthful and handsome face.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.810
By all accounts, he's a fine-looking man,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.630
wouldn't you say?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.760
A fine-looking man?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.270
What fine-looking man?

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.000
A fiend!

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.790
The fiend from that great mural

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.050
in the Chengfo Temple!

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.080
The mural?

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.030
Madam, are you referring

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.670
to the "Subjugation of Devils" mural
in the Great Buddha Hall?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.910
That's the one! That mural

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.150
is filled with nothing
but demons and monsters!

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.870
Chi Ying,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.510
I won't allow you to speak like that!

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.630
The "Subjugation of Devils"

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.150
is the life's work of Qin Xiaobai,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.200
the Greatest Painter of the Tang Empire!

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.270
Why would he pour his heart and soul

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.530
into painting such demons and monsters?

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.440
If that mural

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.440
hadn't been

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.720
trapped under cobwebs,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.480
who knows what chaos

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.030
would have befallen Chang'an by now!

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.840
And besides,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.720
of all places, why did he

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.670
have to paint it

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.400
right next to the Great Buddha?

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.310
That's right—

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.870
I often took Wu Yang there
to pay respects to the Buddha.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.270
Could it be
that while we were worshipping,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.270
some demon from the mural noticed her,

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.320
broke free from the wall,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.480
and kidnapped my daughter?

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.150
Silence!

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.670
One more word of this nonsense,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.130
and I'll have you removed!

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.890
This is my establishment.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120
Then I'm leaving!

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.180
Well? Aren't you going after her?

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.720
Xijun.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.280
I know. I shouldn't have
lost my temper like that.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.320
About the story behind Qin Xiaobai's mural

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.550
"Subjugation of Devils",

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.120
nobody knows it better than you do.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.720
Of course you'd be upset

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.270
to hear his life's work dismissed

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.730
as some demonic painting.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.280
I thought you came out here

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.870
to lecture me.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.780
How could I?

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.830
Your sketches

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.960
have been crucial to the investigation—

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.090
if anything, I should be thanking you.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.790
I'm sorry.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.000
I truly couldn't hold back earlier.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.600
You've been drawing for two days straight—
you must be exhausted.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.000
Go back and get some rest.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.550
No.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.960
I'm going to Chengfo Temple.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.750
I want to see
the "Subjugation of Devils" for myself

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.280
and clear away the cobwebs.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.480
A masterpiece like that
shouldn't be left in the dust.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.200
Very well.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.080
If official duties weren't pressing,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.030
I'd go with you.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.650
That's alright.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.790
Thank you, Lu Lingfeng.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.390
You're the sanitation worker
from Shengye District?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.360
That's right, Officer.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.630
May I ask your name?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.600
Officer,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.820
someone of my low standing

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.720
doesn't really deserve a proper name.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.580
But since I'm a bit slow by nature,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.130
folks around the district
just call me Woody—

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.570
like a block of wood.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.000
Woody...

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.510
It has a friendly ring to it.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.150
Woody,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.510
since you

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.720
clean the district,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.150
do you know Wu Yang,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.440
the daughter of the owner

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.740
of this skincare shop?

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.820
Yes, I've often

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.440
seen her around here.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.750
You know she's disappeared?

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.430
So I've heard.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.240
Do you know who he is?

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.650
Yes, I do.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.270
The Yongzhou Judicial Official—

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.600
Lu Lingfeng of Fanyang.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.750
He holds circuit trials around the city

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.960
and enters the districts
to investigate cases.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.220
I was present that day.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:27.790
Woody,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.840
you were watching me
from the corner of your eye earlier.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.080
Do you have information
about Wu Yang's disappearance?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.140
Not about that, no.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.480
But...

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.480
But what?

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.270
Well...

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.300
about the man who drowned in the well—

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.750
I do know something,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600
though I'm not sure

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.800
if it counts as a clue.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.600
Tell me.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.910
Well, it's my duty

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.460
as a sanitation worker

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.080
to have all the refuse sorted and ready

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.510
to be carted out of Chang'an

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.240
by 3 AM

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.600
every night.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.110
But the night before last...

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.910
Get lost!

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:10.970
Out of my way!

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.670
You're a roadblock,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.630
aren't you?

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.150
You filthy sanitation worker!

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.410
Clean this mess up now!

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.720
Had you seen Kuai Wu before this?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:20.790
Yes.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.270
He used to drink often at the restaurant.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.840
Sometimes, when he stumbled home drunk

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.320
past where I sorted the trash,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.080
he'd pick a fight

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.940
and curse at me.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.200
But that night,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.120
he seemed far more wasted—

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.530
looked like he could collapse any second.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.200
Shameless pig!

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.870
Disgusting!

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.080
You shameless pig!

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.790
How dare you grope me!

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.680
It serves you right, drowning in a well!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.000
She said that?

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.030
Yes.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.550
I'd brushed it off

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.510
at the time,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.320
but the next day,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.320
I heard he was dead.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.440
You're the night watch
from Shengye District.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.100
Why are you dressed like this?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.650
As a woman working the night shift,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.780
these clothes

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.490
help ward off evil spirits.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.110
But it's broad daylight now.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.750
Won't you scare people

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.210
walking around like that?

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.390
I have a second trade—

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.920
I'm a spirit medium.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.530
If you wish to contact the departed

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.030
and speak with lost loved ones,

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.960
I can help.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.670
My rates are quite fair.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.840
Excellent.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.270
Our revered mentor passed away years ago.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:36.960
We were both

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.720
his disciples—

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720
can you let us

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.440
see our mentor again?

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.200
Yes,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.150
of course!

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.390
Just tell me the honored name
and hometown

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.520
of your late mentor.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.390
Our mentor was Di Renjie.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.150
Di...

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:54.960
Di...

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.390
Master Di?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.960
I'm afraid my arts

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.690
are powerless to contact
a spirit of his caliber.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.270
So this "spirit medium" act

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.550
is just a scheme
to swindle people, isn't it?

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:05.920
Go!

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.960
Wash that paint off your face

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.760
and come back to speak properly.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.160
Yes,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.680
I did say those words—

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.589
but it was just a curse, nothing more.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.190
He was so much bigger than me;

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:19.960
how could I

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.619
have pushed him into the well?

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.510
That Woody—

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.920
I only took twenty coins from him,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.780
and now he's falsely accusing me.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.200
Woody spends all day cleaning garbage—

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.550
how much could he possibly earn?

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.350
And you even swindled his money?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.960
He wanted to contact his father

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.400
to ask about some major life decision.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.000
I was only trying to help him.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.590
That night,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.200
besides Kuai Wu,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.750
did you see anyone else suspicious?

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:50.830
No.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.250
Let me give you some advice:

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.030
stop this spirit medium scam

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.680
to cheat people out of their money.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.550
If I quit being a spirit medium,

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.480
how else will I ever save up enough?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.260
What trouble have you caused now?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.720
What a disgrace!

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.510
And now you've been summoned!

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.790
Hurry up, make enough money,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.050
and get out of my house!

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.930
Now, get out!

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.550
Her name was originally Ling.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.880
After her husband died,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.510
her mother-in-law turned vicious—

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.370
always beating and berating her.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.550
The district head gave her

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.510
the night watch job

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.590
out of pity.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.310
About half a year ago,
she started working as a spirit medium,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.030
calling herself "Auntie Ling."

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.440
But everyone knows

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.510
she's just doing it for the money—

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.200
her mother-in-law has set a price:

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.930
once she saves up 10,000 coins,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.240
she’s free to leave.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.240
Once we solve this case,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.790
I'm going

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.030
to have a serious talk

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.630
with Ling's mother-in-law.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.370
I'll go with you.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.720
You two are surprisingly decent,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.920
aren't you?

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.280
[Chengfo Temple]

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:47.650
[Great Buddha Hall]

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.270
I simply wish to use common pigments
to execute the dotting technique

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.400
with more brilliance than
if I had used "Wandering Light."

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.070
Only then

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.030
would I be worthy

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.890
of the title
"Greatest Painter of the Tang Empire."

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.880
Demons

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.720
cannot enter the Buddha's gaze.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.200
In the eyes of the Buddha,
there are no demons—

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.440
how could there be any in his heart?

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.980
What's wrong with you?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.720
It's nothing.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.750
You're bleeding—

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.240
so much blood.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.110
I know a miracle doctor.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.070
Let me bring him to treat you.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.470
That won't be necessary.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.240
The bleeding happened last night;

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.640
it's long since stopped.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.210
It's just this splitting headache—

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.270
so severe

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:11.920
I've been lying here

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.720
all night in a daze.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880
If I may, sir...

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.510
you look somewhat familiar.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.640
May I ask who you are?

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.170
I am Householder Chenkong,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.070
the keeper of this hall.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.640
Then...

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.550
who injured you?

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.540
Last night,

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.590
two ruffians broke in.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.480
They were probably aiming
to steal these ritual objects.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.510
I fought them,

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.790
and as a result...

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.310
You must report this
to the authorities at once.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.590
The current Yongzhou Judicial Official

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.450
is Lu Lingfeng—

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.200
No need.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.310
Those villains

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.400
dared to commit violence
before the Buddha—

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.000
retribution will find them.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.000
Now, young lady,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.590
how did you get in?

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.090
Through the main gate.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.480
Why have you come?

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.890
To clean the mural—

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.200
to clear away the dust.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.130
Absolutely not.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.640
Why not?

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.830
The "Subjugation of Devils"
is a treasure of Chengfo Temple.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.720
It should be kept clean.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.830
As for the reason,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.160
you need not know.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.790
In fact,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.830
you should not

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.400
even be inside this hall.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.480
Please leave.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.130
You kept your word, Miss Xijun,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.790
and have truly come to offer incense.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.250
Please,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.010
come to the quarter for tea.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.640
Later,

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.160
I shall personally accompany you

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.110
to the Guanyin Hall for your prayers.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.510
Buddhist, as you know,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.590
when Master Qin Xiaobai painted
the "Subjugation of Devils,"

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.240
I visited this hall many times.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.680
Now that I've returned to Chang'an,

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.400
I wish to admire the mural once more

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.480
and clear its dust.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.310
But Householder Chenkong, the keeper,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.480
not only refused to let me clean it—

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.750
he drove me out.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.920
Ah, Miss Xijun, there is something
you do not understand.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.240
That mural truly must not be cleaned.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.680
Moreover,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.110
one should not

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.370
casually enter that hall anymore at all.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.400
Xijun,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.680
I know my "Master Fei" cooking

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.510
is nothing special,

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.350
but you should at least try a bite—

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.160
do it for me?

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.680
I can't eat.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.200
My heart is too heavy,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.750
thinking of the "Subjugation of Devils"
covered in dust.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.080
A woman's weeping
in the Great Buddha Hall?

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.920
Chi Ying mentioned she took Wu Yang there—

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.680
could it be Wu Yang crying?

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.800
Impossible.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.390
Buddhist Guangxiao said...

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.720
"It began two months ago—

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.590
one night, someone heard a woman sobbing

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.000
from that hall,

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.510
and it has continued every night since.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.720
Since then, our Chengfo Temple

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.640
has grown quiet, its visitors sparse,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.500
its incense offerings dwindled.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.480
Even I am

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.510
at a loss."

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.640
What puzzles me

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.000
is why they refuse to let anyone

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.930
clean the mural.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.350
As for the weeping—

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.950
if it started two months ago,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.790
it can't be related to Wu Yang.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.270
No wonder

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.070
the abbot greeted us

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.880
so warmly that day—

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.280
the temple must be desperate for visitors.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.590
It is strange

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.550
that they forbid cleaning the mural.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.200
Still,

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.640
Guangxiao the abbot

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.590
struck me as a good man.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.590
You can't judge character

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.480
by appearance.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.960
Nightly weeping,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.640
so eerie—

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.070
why hasn't this been reported
to the authorities?

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.070
Chengfo Temple is surely involved.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.000
Well now, Xue Huan,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.260
quite the bold theory you have there!

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.510
I believe

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.100
Captain Xue

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.130
makes a valid point.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.360
Alright, alright—we'll follow your lead.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.480
Xijun,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.350
if you can't eat,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.230
let me accompany you for a walk instead.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.880
What are you all staring at?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.310
Fei,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.030
this dish is quite intriguing.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.270
Though prepared in the style of Chang'an,

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.720
I can taste both

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.440
the delicacy of Nanzhou Prefecture

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.640
and the bold richness of Yunding County
in its flavors.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.240
Is that so?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.830
Here, let's have a drink, a drink!

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.030
A toast to you, to you!

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.010
It really is deserted.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.640
It seems no one

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.390
guards this hall after dusk.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.030
Xijun,

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.240
you can clean the mural without worry—

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.700
no one should disturb you.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.900
[Great Buddha Hall]

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.200
How did it come to this?

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.240
Who's crying there?

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.520
Don't be afraid,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.610
it must be the wind.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.950
Let me light a candle.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.360
I wonder where Master Qin

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.920
is now.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.520
I know you've always regretted

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.040
not being able
to formally study under him.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.480
Today,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.610
in clearing the dust

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.000
from Master Qin's mural,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.920
carefully appreciating his brushwork,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.180
and contemplating the beauty of his art,

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.640
I have found my own way

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.170
to pay homage to the master.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.650
Who's there?

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.680
It's me.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.550
It's me.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.440
Please don't hit me.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.200
Don't hit me.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.280
I'm begging you.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.920
I beg you, don't hit me!

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.280
Why are you here?

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.590
I know

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.830
we're not usually allowed
in the Great Buddha Hall.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.880
But I truly can't sleep

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.750
unless I'm near the Buddha's feet.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.160
I slipped in

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.880
when Householder Chenkong

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.810
wasn't looking.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.160
Who are you?

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.830
What was that?

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.640
I am Lu Lingfeng,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.790
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.270
Oh, I see

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.980
you're an officer.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:20.800
Answer me.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.400
It's said that a woman's weeping

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.930
is often heard in this hall.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.160
Have you heard it?

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.920
I'm hard of hearing—

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.480
I can't hear it.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.110
Then have you been pretending
to be a weeping woman

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.710
to scare off other visitors?

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.160
With this old voice of mine,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.360
how could I possibly imitate a woman's?

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.480
Officer,

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.720
I sold my charcoal well today

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.830
for a fair price—

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.130
please, take these few coins
as a token of my respect.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.280
What is this for?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.720
I beg you, Officer,

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.510
please don't tell Buddhist Guangxiao

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.830
or Householder Chenkong.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:56.590
If they find out

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.550
I've been sleeping here,

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.150
they won't

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.110
let me

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.770
into Chengfo Temple anymore.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.240
What is your surname, elder?

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.510
I...

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.440
my surname is Tao.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.680
Mr. Tao,

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.960
keep your money.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.880
We won't tell them.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.880
But... don't you have a home?

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.350
Selling charcoal

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.550
does earn a little,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.070
but not enough

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.530
to buy a house in Chang'an.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.440
I sleep wherever I can.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:24.400
Mr. Tao,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.110
tomorrow you can go to the Pei's Mansion

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.680
near the southern gate
of Chongren District—

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.540
that's my home.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.480
We have a few empty rooms;

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.640
we can spare one

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.350
for you to stay in for a while.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.310
Thank you, young lady.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.030
Thank you.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.590
I'll leave you

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.110
to your business.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.480
Thank you.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.270
Thank you, thank you.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.000
Thank you so much.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.640
Finally, it's done.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.840
Thank you for your help,
Judicial Official Lu.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.590
A masterpiece like this mural

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.520
deserves to shine in all its glory.

[Great Buddha Hall]

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.750
What demon dares

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.100
to light candles in this hall?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.370
It's Guangxiao.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.640
What do we do?

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.360
I've caused trouble.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.120
Cleaning the mural at night was my idea.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.370
This has nothing to do with you.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.090
There are shadows!

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.160
They're not ghosts—

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.090
they're people!

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.100
They're human!

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.510
If they're human, there's nothing to fear.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:07.850
Let's go! Let's go!

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.550
Buddhist Guangxiao, it's been a while.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.510
Lu Lingfeng?

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.200
Miss Pei,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.920
I already told you,

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.430
this hall should not be entered lightly.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.960
Why have you come back?

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.610
Mentor!

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.550
Look!

Amitabha!

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.640
A sin!

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.590
A grave sin!

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.550
Mentor.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.880

Amitabha!

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.400
O Buddha!

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.850
You revealed to your disciples

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.830
that we must trap these demons

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.270
beneath dust and cobwebs.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.310
We followed
your divine instruction faithfully,

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.310
and now it has been

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.510
utterly destroyed!

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.400
This is not our fault!

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.790
Lu Lingfeng,

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.550
soon demons and monsters will pour forth!

Blood and chaos

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.640
will drench Chang'an!

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.030
And you two

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.920
are to blame!

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.880
-Yes, you are to blame!
-Yes, you are to blame!

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.070
-It's your fault!
-Your fault!

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.530
What demons and monsters?

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.510
I am the newly appointed
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.370
While I'm here,

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880
let's see

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.370
who dares to bring chaos to Chang'an!

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.480
Lu Lingfeng,

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.030
do you think your rank

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.640
allows you to act so recklessly?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.200
Exactly!

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.270
I will report you!

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.110
I will bring this
before the Emperor himself!

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.270
Yes, report him!

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.310
Buddhist Guangxiao,

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.170
what exactly do you intend
to accuse Lu Lingfeng of?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.720
Su Wuming?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.510
You'd report him
for helping Chengfo Temple clean,

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.880
for clearing the dust

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.660
from this magnificent mural?

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.960
I will report him
for unleashing demons and monsters!

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.200
I don't believe there's a statute

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.930
for that in the Tang legal code.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.000
Su Wuming,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.160
you don't know the full story.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.310
I've heard a little.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.270
Two months ago,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.510
in the deep of night,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.750
a woman's weeping was heard in this hall.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.510
Yes, yes.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.610
Afterwards,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.830
the Buddha appeared in a dream

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.790
to Householder Chenkong—
the hall's keeper—

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.270
instructing us to seal this mural

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.960
with dust and cobwebs

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.160
to prevent demons

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.550
from terrorizing Chang'an.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.400
And since then, temple attendance
has dwindled,

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.510
and you even

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.680
closed the Great Buddha Hall.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.590
What else could we do?

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.790
After that, did the weeping

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.920
stop?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.160
No.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.510
It grew even louder—

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.680
sometimes, several women

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680
crying together.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:50.240
True!

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.030
I heard it yesterday too—

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.230
utterly terrifying!

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.270
Yes.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.720
-Exactly.
-Absolutely spine-chilling!

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.680
Captain Xue,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.200
what was it

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.920
you said at home earlier?

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.030
I, Xue Huan, the captain
of the Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.690
am now conducting an inquiry!

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.200
Okay.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.660
Such a bizarre matter—

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.320
why was it never reported
to the authorities?

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.510
What is Chengfo Temple

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.239
so maliciously trying to hide?

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.280
T-This…

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:17.800
Captain Xue,

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.630
Buddhist Guangxiao
is a monk of great virtue and prestige.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.880
This manner of questioning

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.480
is somewhat inappropriate.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.840
The Yongzhou Judicial Official

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.630
holds circuit trials around the city

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.280
and enters the districts
to investigate cases.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.190
Learning of this

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.739
during an investigation,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.400
he came at night to inspect—

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.710
all part of standard procedure.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.360
How could this anger the Abbot enough

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.040
to threaten an accusation
before the Emperor?

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:50.730
This…

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.800
Buddhist,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.880
do you truly believe

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.030
cobwebs

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.230
can hold back demons?

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.150
Then tell me,

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.760
why did the woman's weeping not stop?

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.320
Well...

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.550
By your logic,

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.360
now that the mural is restored,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.110
the demons

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.880
should emerge at any moment?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:15.710
W-Well...

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:16.840
This...

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.440
Well then.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.630
Let everyone return to rest.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.280
The six of us

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.200
will stay the night in this hall

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.000
and wait for them to appear.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.480
No, you mustn't!

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.150
You mustn't!

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.210
In the past, the so-called Demon Lord

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.960
and his horde

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.320
were vanquished here.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.670
If any dare return,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.630
let Judicial Official Lu

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.030
deal with them again.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.960
I had a hand

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.630
in that myself, you know.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.040
That fierce beast, Qiongqi—

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.960
I subdued it!

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.920
Yes, indeed.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.150
And I

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.870
slew the female demon—

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.710
just an old woman

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.110
in disguise, as it turned out.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.230
Buddhist Guangxiao,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.800
if I recall, you were
in this very hall that day.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.510
Did you not see it with your own eyes?

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.370
Yes, it's true.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.390
Buddhist Guangxiao,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.000
even if you wish to accuse me,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.150
must it be tonight?

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.880
If you rush to the palace now,

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.000
would you even be granted an audience?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.440
I…

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.280
would not.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.310
Everyone,

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.800
Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.880
are both disciples of Master Di.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.230
Let us temporarily

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.810
place our trust in them.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:22.940
For now,

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.510
return to your quarters,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.760
bar your doors and windows,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.280
and recite the Diamond Sutra
for protection.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.190
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.150
Amitabha.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.110
-Amitabha.
-Amitabha.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.190
It is strange—

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.960
when Xijun and I first entered the hall,

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.890
we truly did hear

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.440
a woman's weeping.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.110
Yes,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.320
faintly—

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.760
just those two sounds,

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.800
then nothing.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.230
It seems even demons and ghosts

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.090
fear my mentor.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.710
Xue Huan,

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.560
you are now a captain
serving the Tang Empire.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.960
Remember my words

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.590
well:

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.800
this world holds neither gods

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.710
nor ghosts—

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.150
only people who pretend to be them.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.240
Understood.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.240
What's wrong?

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.840
Nothing, nothing.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.360
Then why the alarm?

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.320
You startled me.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.000
Exactly.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.360
What I mean is,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.480
though this hall looks fresh
and clean now,

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.840
it could still use some repairs.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.230
Look,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.260
there's a hole over there.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.230
Where?

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.170
Right there, right there.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.000
If it rains,

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.460
it'll surely leak.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.510
Everyone,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.360
my injury is newly healed—

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.550
sitting all night is too much for me.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.280
I… I see a mat over there;

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.510
I'll go lie down for a while.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.440
Go on, then.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.760
Now what's wrong?

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.400
Don't move!

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.690
Stay where you are!

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.000
Did you use

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.530
Fairy Beauty Powder today?

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.110
No.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.150
Xijun, did you use it?

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.400
Yes.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.280
Quite a bit, in fact.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.190
And did you come
into contact with that mat?

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.670
No.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.920
Fei,

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.360
are you saying this mat

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.480
carries the scent
of Fairy Beauty Powder?

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.030
Yes,

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.540
and it's quite strong.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.630
The old man sleeping here earlier

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.830
was a charcoal seller

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.760
named Mr. Tao.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.080
He's hard of hearing.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.960
He claims he can only sleep

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.360
at the feet of the Buddha.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.070
Mr. Tao...

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.070
[Sesame Bake]

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.150
Give me a few of the big ones.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.000
A few of the big ones, you say?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.670
I'll take this one, and this one too.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:54.320
This one—the big chunks burn longer.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.480
My charcoal burns well, doesn't it?

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.400
Indeed, it's great.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.550
Then how about another piece?

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.150
Sure, sure.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.880
That's enough, that's plenty.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.590
Duke Zhao,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.710
how have you been these days?

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.670
I've come to see you.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.780
The woman named Wu Yang

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.440
I mentioned the other day—

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:03.800
My golden tablet...

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.940
Where is my golden tablet?

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.660
Who stole my golden tablet?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.710
You old fool—

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.510
so you are connected
to Wu Yang's disappearance.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.170
Who are you?

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.100
The one arresting you.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.510
You?

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.840
Such arrogance, lady.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.510
Don't be afraid, Yingtao!

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.440
Scholar Su sent us

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.900
to assist you discreetly.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.670
Watch his weapon!

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.810
An armor-piercing awl.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.920
I've heard this weapon is formidable—

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.180
first time seeing one.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.480
It's mine now.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.190
You dare take my weapon!

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.880
Yes,

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.880
I took it!

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.860
And since you injured Liu,

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.360
I'll take your life too!

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.070
Wait!

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.800
You can have my life.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.360
But before you kill me,

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.280
I beg you—

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.360
help me recover that golden tablet.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:28.230
It concerns the very fate
of the Tang Empire.
