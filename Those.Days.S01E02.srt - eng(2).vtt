=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

=Episode 2=

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.580
I'll drive you back.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.020
Later, I'll take a bus to come back.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.860
No need.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.660
Now you care about me.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.980
Zhixia,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.980
Look. Now that you're pregnant,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.100
you should get angry less

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.980
and move around less.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.840
I haven't decided
whether to have the baby or not.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.180
Why are you agreeing with her?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.740
Of course, you want it.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100
Let her make the decision.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.860
Don't listen to your father.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.020
Men know nothing

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.460
about the pain of giving birth.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.900
The child is already here.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.100
How can she not keep it?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.860
You need to respect her...

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.660
Enough.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.340
I know what I know.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.060
Yes. She can...

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.900
Just don't argue, both of you.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.660
You...

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.460
Enough.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.940
I'm going back.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.660
Delete my number.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.500
Delete it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.860
Be careful.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.940
Go.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.900
Careful, Zhixia.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.580
Dear, you are so pretty.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.890
We'll go to the first floor for
the photoshoot when both of you are ready.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.500
All right.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.100
Let's go.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.220
Wait.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.780
You will soon become a mother.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.300
I must protect both of you.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900
When will you be home?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.860
My mother is here.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.340
Zhang Hao,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.780
look.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.020
It's full of dust.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.020
If you don't sweep your house,
you won't dominate the world.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.740
Wipe it off.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.900
Are you judging my house
by the standards of a five-star hotel?

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.340
What?

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.980
What are these?

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.580
Water bills?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.660
More than 100 yuan for two months?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.740
How are you using water?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.780
How?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.180
Did you open a bathhouse?

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.660
Our country's water resources

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.220
are very limited.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.660
Come here, Mom.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.740
Sit down.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.140
Take a break.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.620
Enough with your observation.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.660
Isn't a home

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.180
and an enterprise the same?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.820
If you don't have a supervision system,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.620
that won't do.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.900
It'll be ruined immediately,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.740
with problems festering like tumors.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.300
You're using idioms now?

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.180
Mom, you're here?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.580
I heard you are pregnant

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.020
so I came here immediately

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.420
to take a look at you.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.820
Seriously.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.300
If you give birth to a boy,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.820
you'll have a son and a daughter.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.300
Our family's structure

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.900
will go through a huge change.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.940
It'll be perfect!

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.140
We haven't decided
whether to have the child or not.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.260
Why not?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.820
It's expensive.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.700
Jiao needs to learn the piano,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.260
ice skating, and English.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.780
They all cost money. It's expensive.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.140
You have me.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.780
I will support you.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.260
Mom,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.060
I thank you

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.740
for willing to subsidize us

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.940
but if we raise another child,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.140
the structure of the family
will really change.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.260
This house won't be big enough for us.

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:00.916
We need a three-room unit.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.540
I'm running a we-media account.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.980
I work for myself.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.820
I can still survive today
but I might lose my job tomorrow.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.420
Of course, Zhang Hao's job is stable

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.380
but his pay is miserably low.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.340
It's very difficult for us
to find another place to live.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.340
- However, I think the house...
- Let me finish.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.580
When I had Jiao,
I was in my late twenties.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.940
Now, I'm already in my late thirties.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.660
My stamina and energy
aren't as good as they were.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.340
I'm a middle-aged woman now.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.940
I have parents and a kid
to take care of.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.090
It's like having enemies on both sides.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.380
If I raise

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.780
another child,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.900
I think

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.860
I won't be able to handle it.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.820
Zhixia,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.860
I think there's always a way.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.500
Look at the families of the past.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.580
All of them

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.660
had more than five children.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.660
- Yes.
- They all grew up fine.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.620
That's right.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.180
That was in the past.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.780
No.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.460
Worry about giving birth
and not about how to raise a child.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.860
It's the same for every generation.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.980
Here's what I think.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.660
Why is the birth rate so low?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.380
Because young people

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.700
have too many considerations

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.620
when they give birth to a child.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.180
Zhixia,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.060
let me take a stand right now.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.660
You just need to give birth.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.340
The baby will
stay in your stomach for a while.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.300
I will feed and raise the child.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.300
Let me

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.780
raise this child
to be the country's successor.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.140
Mom.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.480
- Well...
- What time is it now?

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.140
I should go back.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.460
You are pregnant.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.020
You need to sleep early.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.980
Rest well.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.380
Rest early.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.180
I'm leaving.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.460
- Let me send you off.
- Sit down.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.180
Don't move.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.700
Don't move right now.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.380
I'm going back.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.500
- Let me send you off.
- All right.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.620
Mom, take care.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.700
Slowly.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.420
I'm leaving.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.140
Take care.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.900
Bye.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.260
When you go out...

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.260
You speak so fast.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.780
Let's have the baby.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.620
My mother said she'd raise him.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.660
The three greatest lies of the world are

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.820
the physician's secret formula
in the martial world,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.380
get-rich-quick schemes
from direct sales groups,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.560
and your mother saying
she'll help you raise the child.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.260
Why are you saying...

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.860
What's wrong with that?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.620
When I was pregnant with Jiao,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.020
your mother said the same thing.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.140
You only need to give birth.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.250
The child will only stay
in your stomach for a while.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.940
What next, Zhang Hao?

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.370
Before I left my confinement period,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.060
she said her company
wants to rehire her.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.100
It was as if
the earth needed her to spin.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.980
If my mother didn't volunteer,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.020
I couldn't even go to work

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.860
after my maternity leave.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.140
Yes.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.820
See? My mother is not dependable

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.780
but I am.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.060
Have I been nurturing Jiao well

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.060
in every aspect
including her daily necessities?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.380
Of course, you've contributed more.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.940
I still took care of her studies, right?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.780
You need to believe in the people.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.620
No.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.500
I am the people.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.460
I only believe in myself.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.860
The city

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.860
is still the same after all these years.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.480
It's still as run down as ever.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.460
It has changed a little.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.060
Mom.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.820
This is the environment of an old city.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.300
Look at that path along the river.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.260
How beautiful it is.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.900
If I don't drive

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.900
and ride a shared bike,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.820
I'll reach the design institute
in ten minutes.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.620
Feng Jianqi,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.220
many people work their whole lives
in the old city

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.220
just to buy a condominium with a lift

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.980
but you have given up
on your bright future

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.860
and chose a path less taken.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.580
I don't know what you are thinking.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.860
Your father's colleagues introduced you

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.380
to the daughter of a commissioner

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.540
and the niece of the chief.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.340
All of them
were better than Shen Mingzhu.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.780
Mom, what do you mean?

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.900
That's enough.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.660
Didn't we agree
not to bring this up again?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.660
I'm telling you.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.820
I am an educated person.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.740
My culture

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.740
is built on money.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.700
Fine. You are educated

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.580
and you are cultured.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.220
Yes.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.700
There are a few more dishes.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.780
Hurry up. They'll be here soon.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.300
It's the last one.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.500
We haven't changed our clothes yet.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.340
I know.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.620
Dad!

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.540
You are making

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.660
all your secret dishes today.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.780
Enough nonsense.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.940
Ask your sister

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.940
where they are now.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.460
Mingzhu,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.380
Dad is asking where Jianqi is.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.580
They'll be here soon!

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.860
They have entered the old city.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.320
They've entered the old city?

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.780
So many dishes.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.780
Eat one.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.300
You're eating already?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.840
- They won't notice a missing prawn.
- Eat.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.140
What are you doing?

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.980
I'm blurred.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.900
Boss, two people.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.420
Here you go.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.460
Just put it here.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.780
Sorry.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.980
There's a joyous occasion
in our family today.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.460
Have a cigarette.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.860
Have a cigarette. Here.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.460
Thank you.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.420
We won't be opening today.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.530
There's a joyous occasion?

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.460
All right.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.460
- Sure.
- Sorry.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.820
Hurry up.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.420
Come again.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.060
Sure.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.580
Hang up the sign saying we are closed.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:14.940
Hurry up.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.820
Mom, help me clean up.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.380
I...

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.980
This kid.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.220
Shen, hurry up!

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.500
Get changed!

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.330
Your face is so oily.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.780
Throw this.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.860
Give it to me.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.140
Quickly! Go upstairs!

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.420
Go and get changed. Hurry.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.380
Go on.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.380
(Western Ginseng, Expiry Date)

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.460
The Western Ginseng is going to expire.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.180
There's still a month to go.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.860
Tell them to eat it quickly.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.700
It's very nourishing.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.180
Mom,

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.580
this is not right.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.660
What's not right about it?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.180
The Western Ginseng is very expensive,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:46.900
I'm telling you.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.060
I'm sure they won't
spend money to buy it.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.340
Jianqi, let me tell you.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.620
Western Ginseng must be kept dry.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.340
It can still be eaten
as long as it's not expired.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.060
It's fine.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.740
That's right.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.340
Dad. This is not about
whether it can still be eaten or not

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.260
but whether we are
showing them respect or not.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.960
Feng Jianqi, what are you talking about?

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.180
How are we not respecting them?

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.660
Both of us

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:05.900
are bringing so many gifts

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.140
to visit

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.500
a shop run by a married couple.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.620
Is that not showing respect?
What else do you want?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.500
Mom, isn't that what we should do?
I'm getting married.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.820
That's enough. Stop arguing.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.580
Just leave the Western Ginseng.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.020
That's a small matter.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.140
Jianqi,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.460
a marriage
is merging two families together.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.940
There'll be conflicts in the future.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.340
Don't simply start an argument.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.900
After all, Mingzhu is a good girl.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.220
Your mother is also a good mother.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.220
A good mother?

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.860
Am I not?

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.580
You are.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.420
Brother!

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.900
There's another car!

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.940
Slowly. Be careful of the child.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.740
There's another car!

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.500
Deal with it!

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:50.940
Slowly!

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.140
Hurry up!

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.300
Go! Quickly!

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.540
A member of my neighbor's family
is getting married.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.180
Later, their in-laws are coming.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.040
Can you leave a spot?

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.220
Help me out.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.740
There's no parking here.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.380
Help me out. Thank you.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.020
Mister.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.980
My sister...

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.220
She's very ugly.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.180
She finally

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.140
got married.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.460
Can you do a good deed and help us out?

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.860
There's a parking area
in front after turning left.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.900
Yes. It's very near.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.820
Fine.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.500
Thank you.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.660
Mingzhu, look.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.300
How do I look?

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.580
Dad, you are so handsome.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.460
A new shirt.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.540
Mingzhu,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.820
is this your perfume?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:28.740
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.940
Put your hands up.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.340
You smell like oil and smoke.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.140
Mom.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.500
This is for women.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.860
It's fine. It just has to smell good.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.660
Why are you spraying this?

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.100
You smell like oil and smoke.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.620
Put your hands up and close your eyes.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.460
You haven't opened it.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.860
I was wondering...

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.780
Turn around and close your eyes.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.060
Quickly. They'll be here soon.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.140
What are you doing?

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.180
You can't just spray him

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.860
like spraying a cockroach.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.180
Your mother
always treats me like a pest.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.300
That's better.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:51.860
- Is that fine?
- Hurry.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.500
Hurry. Let's go.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.180
Let's go.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.780
Wait.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.140
Is my necklace sitting right?

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.660
Yes.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.340
It's straight.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.580
Let's go.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.580
Wait.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.020
Should I roll up my sleeves
or button it?

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.860
No need. That's good enough.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.060
Button it.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.780
All right.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.940
Congratulations.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.300
Run slowly.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.740
You'll get wedding candies later.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.660
Look at the clear weather.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.160
Look how happy your mom and dad are.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.140
They are here.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.340
They are here.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.500
Hurry.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.700
Just park here.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.140
It's all our place.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.020
Just park here.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.780
All right.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.820
I've never seen this before.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.020
It's a premium car.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.100
It's a premium car.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.140
Welcome.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.220
Slowly.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.540
Hello.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.700
- Hello.
- Mr. Feng.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.900
They are my parents.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.140
This is Shen Minghui,
my younger brother.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:33.820
Hello, Mr. Feng and Mrs. Feng.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.580
Hello.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.900
What's wrong?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.460
Who put on so much perfume?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.540
I'm allergic.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.620
Shen.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.500
This is a small road.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.700
Must be tough
for a premium car like yours.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.940
It's all right.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.060
I also lived in Old City.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:52.940
When I was young,

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.420
I was running around here.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.900
However, nothing much has changed

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.780
after so many years.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.340
Yes.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.780
I feel like I've returned
to the time when I was young.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.020
Mrs. Feng,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.140
don't say that.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.460
You are still very young now.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.180
Look how healthy your skin is.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.660
There aren't any wrinkles.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.900
You don't look like
a grandmother at all.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.060
Women must take care of themselves.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:13.980
Mingzhu,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.580
share the bird's nest
I'm giving you with your mother.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.580
Sure.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.140
Dad, let's talk inside.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:20.860
Yes.

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:22.708
Why are we standing outside?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.820
Come inside.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.820
Yes. Please come inside.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.740
We'll be going back.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.500
Thank you.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.260
Mingzhu.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.780
You are blessed. How great.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.980
This way, please.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.100
This is an old house.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.380
- Old house.
- It's nice.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.020
This is probably
a few hundred years old.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.660
Sit and talk. Please.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.700
Sit down.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.340
Sure.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.620
What a feast.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.860
There are so many dishes.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.460
What a feast.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.900
Sit down.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.260
Thank you for your treat.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.620
My parents started preparing
for this feast a long time ago.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.660
They bought turtles
from the Western market

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.740
and chicken from the Eastern market.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.220
They've been preparing for many days.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.460
It's just a simple meal.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.140
I don't know
if they suit your taste buds.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.020
That's wonderful.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.900
All of you are too polite.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.420
How can we finish so many dishes?

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.180
All of us have small appetites.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.620
It's fine, Mrs. Feng.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.240
Whether you can finish them or not
doesn't matter.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.460
You are our esteemed guest.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.460
My father used everything he learned
to make these dishes.

00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:19.771
Think of it as his sincerity.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.260
- Sure.
- That's right.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.180
Thank you.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.300
He's right.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.700
It's a show of sincerity.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.180
Well, let me start things off.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.940
Today, I want to welcome the in-laws.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.660
I'll call you that from now on.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.700
Our in-laws have come
to visit our humble abode.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:37.900
Look.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.780
It's has become glorious.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.940
Since we have sat at this table,

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.420
we are a family now.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.180
We will be honest with each other.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.820
I prepared some wine.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.380
Minghui, pour the wine.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.460
Let me do it.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.540
Jianqi.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.460
I'm driving.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.540
I'm driving so I won't be drinking.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.660
Let's drink tea and beverages

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.300
in place of wine.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.620
Thank you for your treat.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.300
That's fine.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.340
Do as you wish.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.260
Let me pour the wine.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.140
I can present myself
to my brother-in-law.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.940
Do you know?

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.780
All right.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.300
Not bad, Feng Jianqi.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.700
You are so hardworking now.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.580
I've never seen you

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.660
pour wine for us at home.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.260
You are so hardworking

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.700
when it comes to serving
your father-in-law and mother-in-law.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.100
Good job.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.780
That's because
Mingzhu has educated you well.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.620
I'm impressed.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.460
You must be joking, Mrs. Feng.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.060
Mingzhu, why are you
still calling her Mrs. Feng?

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.100
Well...

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
Let's wait until
the wedding banquet is completed.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.420
After that, I'll change.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.020
No. You're a legal couple
after getting the certificate.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.420
Call her.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.660
Our family

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.020
is about the traditional rules.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.180
They must bow to their parents

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.900
and get red packets
before they can change.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.540
These are the rules.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.460
Right, Feng?

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.020
Mom.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.460
Stop talking about rules.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.940
I'll change the way I address them.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.180
Dad. Mom.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.260
Let me offer you a toast.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.620
Good.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.460
Drink slowly.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.140
Drink less.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.620
It's all right.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.780
My mission today

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.380
is to drink with Dad until he's happy.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.460
Look at Feng Jianqi.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.020
He is such a sweet talker now.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.100
Mom, what are you saying?

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.260
Mingzhu,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.060
offer a toast to my mom and dad.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:32.620
All right.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.300
Dad.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.420
All right.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.460
Mom.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.540
Mingzhu,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.300
get me a glass of tea.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.100
I don't drink sweet drinks.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:47.940
Sure.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.260
Let me do it.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.660
Well, it was my bad. I forgot.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.820
Mingzhu, sit down.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.540
Let me do it.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:52.940
Minghui can do it.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.700
Let me do it, Mingzhu.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.580
It's all right.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.420
The Shen family is lively today.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.020
Do you know?

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.060
Shen Shengli purposely ordered
a bottle of Wuliangye wine from me.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.260
Really?

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.180
They've spent a lot of money
to please their in-laws.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:05.860
They've spent a lot of money.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.860
Right?

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.980
Kids!

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.420
Stop playing around here!

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.820
Do you know how much the car costs?

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.900
You can't afford to pay. Go away!

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.260
Xiaoni, don't go.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.020
Go!

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.580
Go and play over there!

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.140
Isn't it cool?

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.740
Yes.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.700
It's cool, right?

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.940
So cool.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.500
Isn't the big car pretty?

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.940
Is it pretty?

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.940
You have a big red box in your car

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.940
that you forgot.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.700
It's not a gift.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.340
Do you not want
to give it to your in-laws?

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.660
Don't speak nonsense.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.940
How do you know?

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.840
When my father
goes to my grandfather's house,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.257
he'd always keep something in the car.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.540
Don't speak nonsense.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.500
The child knows nothing.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.140
It's all right.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.180
The child knows nothing
but what about the adult?

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.940
Sorry.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.940
Let's go. Let's go home.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.960
I'm not going home.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960
What are you going to do?

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.180
I'm not going home!

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.460
Can't you see
that they don't welcome us?

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.500
I'm not going home!

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.180
Let's go home.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:00.820
Mom.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.940
They've been neighbors for decades.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.340
Can't you be more polite?

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.100
I hate people who gossip.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.260
People see your politeness
as a blessing.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.940
You need to know where to draw the line.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.420
Why haven't you learned?

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.700
We are here to discuss your marriage

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.580
but you came out

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.340
to play with children.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.140
Come inside.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.420
What will happen
when Mingzhu marries into his family?

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.940
This mother-in-law is hard to please.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.820
She's quite fierce.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.380
Mingzhu will suffer

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.540
in the future.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.140
Cheers.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.460
I'm fine. I'm happy today.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.660
Mr. Shen,

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.460
we are here

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.180
to discuss

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.460
our children's marriage.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.660
Our children's marriage
is a joyous occasion.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.300
So, the wedding

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.700
must be organized

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.740
with splendor.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.940
Absolutely.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.580
A wedding must feel ceremonial.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.500
That's right.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.620
It must be ceremonial.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.180
Whatever you think is suitable,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.580
we will follow suit.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.020
That's right.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.660
As long as it's best for the children,

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.020
we are fine with anything.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.020
We are fine.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.980
All right.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.220
It's like this.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.860
We want

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.580
to organize the wedding at Lijun Hotel.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.900
There's a dome in their banquet hall.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.900
It's very majestic.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.780
It can fit 100 tables.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.580
That's too expensive.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.420
- You'll be paying a lot of money.
- Not at all.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.580
A little expensive is fine.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.980
We make money as parents

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.380
for the sake of our children.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.260
Yes.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.820
You are right.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.900
It's for our children.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.460
Yes.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.580
How many tables
are you going to organize?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.220
We made a rough calculation.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.060
Basically, our family

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.740
has been doing business for a long time

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.100
so we know more people.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.460
There are many

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.340
40 tables might not be enough.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.460
Yes. That's a must.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.660
That's necessary.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.180
All of you know many people.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.820
Right?

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.060
It's normal to have 40 to 50 tables.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.780
That's right.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.740
The more guests,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.060
the more festive it is.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.380
We doesn't have
that many guests.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.540
Just ten tables.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.100
Didn't we agree

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.980
to have at least 15 tables?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.940
Do we have that many people?

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.460
No. Mrs. Shen.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.500
Mr. Shen.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.060
To save money.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.780
Go ahead.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.380
We have a request to ask.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.540
What do you mean?

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.780
Don't be offended by this.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.700
Why should we?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.580
We are discussing the wedding.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.620
There's nothing
to feel offended about. Say it.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.420
It's for them.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.180
That's great.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.220
Well...

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.540
Fine, I'll say it.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.060
It's like this.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.300
We have decided

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.700
to hold our own weddings.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.660
The groom's side

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.260
will be held at Lijun Hotel.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.500
During the wedding,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.580
guests from the bride's side
do not have to attend.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.900
It's too far

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:50.840
and it's inconvenient.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.100
All of you can hold the banquet

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.060
at a nearby hotel.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.100
It's like this?

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.260
We hold our own weddings?

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.180
Well...

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.940
It's still quite reasonable.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.780
Exactly.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.980
Mr. Feng. Mrs. Feng.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.580
I think that's not quite right.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.620
No.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.500
It's not right at all.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.020
What do you mean?

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.180
I think it's right.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.940
Your parents have agreed.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.020
Of course, it's not.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.060
If my parents are not going,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.740
my sister shouldn't go.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.460
Just get Feng Jianqi
to attend on his own.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.820
Shen Minghui, shut up.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.060
The child is speaking nonsense.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.140
Apologize, hurry.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.300
Why should I apologize, Mom?

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.660
They are obviously
looking down on our family.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.340
Why should we apologize?

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.260
Stand up.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.620
Mom, I'm not going back.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.780
If I go back,

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.260
Mingzhu will be badly bullied.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.860
Minghui, calm down.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.660
Me?

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.540
Has your family spoken politely?

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.580
The more polite our family is,
the more your family tries to bully us.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.700
Don't point at others.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.420
My sister is getting married.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.060
Why can't my family attend her wedding?

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.940
Just because it's held at Lijun Hotel?

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.740
Is Lijun Hotel owned by your family?

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.380
Is there a lock or a curfew?

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.980
Shen Minghui!

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.180
Are you going to stop every guest
who is not from the Feng family?

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.860
Shen Minghui!

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.300
Listen to me. Let's go back.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.700
You are so uneducated.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.260
The wedding can be cancelled

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.140
but your sister is pregnant.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.260
Just cancel it!

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.860
Many people are after my sister!

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.860
Just find someone else!

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.500
The child
will call someone else his father!

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:10.980
Shen Minghui.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.740
What are you talking about?

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.140
- Don't touch me!
- I'll beat you up!

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.500
Jianqi!

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.580
Are you all right?

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:17.820
You are bleeding.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.580
Go upstairs!

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.580
Why did you hit him?

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.020
- Why did you hit him?
- Are you all right?

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.700
I'm fine.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.740
Jianqi, you are bleeding.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.260
Are you all right?

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:24.940
Who are you?

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.180
Why did you hit him?

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.980
Jianqi!

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.080
Come home with me.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.580
We don't want that child. Divorce her!

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.460
- Mom.
- Mrs. Feng, what are you saying?

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.580
Who are you calling? I don't know you!
Don't address me.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.180
I don't know you. It's all your fault.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.500
Is that how you talk?

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.140
Stop talking.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.580
Mrs. Feng.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.540
Come home with me.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.300
No.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.220
I'll ask you again.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.260
Come home with me.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.060
No!

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.140
Fine.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.100
Just stay here!

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.380
Stay here!

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:45.940
Let's go!

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.660
Why are you so uneducated?

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.100
That's enough.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.220
I've never seen a mother like you!

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.940
I've been holding back
the entire morning!

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.980
You are just a hag! Look at all of you!

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.420
Who do you think you are?

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.900
You're just pretending to be civilized!

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.900
You are impossible!

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.260
Enough! Stand right here!

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.460
You are being unreasonable!

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.620
Are you all right?

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.020
Report to the police! We'll be waiting!

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.500
Dad!

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.220
Are you all right?

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.660
I'm fine! Go back!

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.740
They are so uncultured.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.380
I'm telling you.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.900
What kind of family is this?

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:10.740
- Sorry.
- I'm telling you.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.820
I won't come back again.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.900
Let's go.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.740
What's happened?

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.620
What's going on?

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.980
- Exactly.
- That's too much.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.460
No.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.300
Mr. Feng!

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.420
Shen has come out.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.380
The child...

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.740
Feng.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.820
Don't take his words to heart.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.420
He's too reckless.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.060
Well...

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.580
Quick.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.300
Make way.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.180
Why are they leaving?

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.700
Sure. Don't be angry.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.380
Why are they angry?

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:34.980
Well...

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.140
What's wrong, Shen?

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.300
What happened, Shen?

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.380
Shen, what happened?

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.340
What's going on?

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.780
Shen, that was your in-laws.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.540
Time to eat!

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.053
Come.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:51.980
Mom,

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.960
if you agree to let me keep a puppy,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.860
I'll agree to you
giving birth to a second baby.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.700
Thanks a lot.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.940
You're welcome.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.780
The kind of dog Wang Ziqian has

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.620
is good enough.

00:25:03.388 --> 00:25:05.410
I did my best to give birth
and raise my daughter.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.820
I brought her up

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.900
just to let her ask me to keep a dog.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.700
I agree.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.380
I like dogs too.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.660
You are the best.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.460
Your father agrees.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.640
I'll leave if the dog is here.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.500
Jiao,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.180
your mother is right
not to let you keep a dog.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.420
Keeping a pet means taking responsibility
for its whole life.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.060
Before you are prepared for that,

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.100
you should be careful.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.980
You are helping your wife instead of me.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.460
Of course, I'm helping my wife.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.540
My wife is our family's commander.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.660
That's right, Commander.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.820
Why are you always
comparing yourself to a dog?

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.780
Is there a commander as sad as I am?

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.660
No one in the family

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.620
makes me feel relieved.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.020
I have to worry about them.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.060
I live worse than a dog
in my middle age.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.660
Wang Ziqian's dog even goes to a spa.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.540
When have I done that in my life?

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.660
It costs 1,000 yuan once.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.660
I only paid 48 yuan for my haircut.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.140
I want to become Wang Ziqian.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.740
So, I can take care of you.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.060
I'm not as good as you.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.020
My haircut is only 15 yuan.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.950
Why are both of you
comparing yourselves to dogs?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.260
What are you thinking about?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.260
My mother

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.580
is asking me to find
my younger sister again.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.780
How can I find her

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.260
when there are so many people?

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.700
I helped you post on the internet.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.660
It's like casting a huge net.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.860
Look at me.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.360
I have to take care of my husband

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.260
and serve my child.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.140
I need to work.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.760
I also need to find my younger sister.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.140
I'm also pregnant with my second child.

00:26:47.418 --> 00:26:48.543
My life is so tough.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.900
Do you think I should give birth or not?

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.340
Let's raise our hands to vote.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.380
I'm the first to agree.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.020
Are you going to agree
if she lets you keep a dog?

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.890
That means
she has abstained from voting.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.820
I've decided.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:02.900
I agree as well.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.500
You change your mind so quickly.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.660
I've thought about it.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.180
If you give birth to another baby,
he wants to keep a dog too.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.660
Then, it'll be two against two.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.300
Ganging up now?

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.500
Yes. We love you together.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.260
I love you.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.740
The baby loves you.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.100
The puppy loves you.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.380
Dad loves you.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.860
Grandfather loves you.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.300
Grandmother loves you.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.860
Uncle loves you.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.460
Mom,

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.460
you have so much love.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300
You have so much love.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.460
Why don't I feel

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.940
my parents love me a lot?

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.340
I also don't think
your brother loves you.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.460
Jiao,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.700
why am I ranked behind the dog?

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.660
Your life is worse than a dog's.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.140
(A harmonious family brings prosperity)

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.500
Minghui!

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.260
Did you find any clothes?

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.580
I did!

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.380
Can I wear them?

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.860
You have to no matter what.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.940
Do you want to be naked?

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.260
Help bring it to me then.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.100
I left it at the door.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.420
Come out and take it yourself.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.620
How can I get it if you put it outside?

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.980
I'm naked.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.900
You're on your own.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.420
Minghui.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.540
It's none of my business.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:25.980
It hurts.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.780
Are you bullying
your brother-in-law again?

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.950
I haven't punished you
for what happened this morning.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.980
I dare not bully him.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.380
I'm waiting for you to give it to him.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.500
Do you want to be beaten up again?

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.380
I'm leaving.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.180
Happiness in my family?

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.180
Your brother

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.220
knows how to pick a shirt.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:00.850
What do you think?

00:29:01.877 --> 00:29:03.197
You look good in anything.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.940
Why doesn't your brother
want me to stay at your house?

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.100
What is he thinking about?

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.940
I'm going to stay here.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.560
I want
to become a matrilocal son-in-law.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.950
I'm going to marry into your family.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.300
Wear your pants.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.060
What happened at the company?

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.140
Why did Wang summon you so urgently?

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.715
The color of a batch of sweaters
was wrongly sent.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.220
We had a meeting
to discuss it until now.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.740
What is he doing usually?

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.180
He's not serious at work.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.780
Jianqi hasn't come back?

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.380
No.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.720
I'm sure he's living
with the Shen family.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.460
Call him and ask around.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.180
No.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.020
Why should I?

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.900
Why must I call him?

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.780
He doesn't want to stay in a big house

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.060
and move to an old, decrepit house

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.580
without a stable power supply.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.740
Whatever.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.820
Just wait. He'll cry.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.300
Does your nose still hurt?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:22.940
No.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.500
Your brother didn't do it on purpose.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.660
Dear.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.300
My parents were too much.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.940
I apologize to you on their behalf.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.860
Why should you apologize?

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.580
They even left their son with me.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.580
You are right.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.140
You should thank me.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.960
♪And the light breeze that passes by♪

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.160
Will your parents blame me

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.660
for causing you to stay here?

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.140
Of course, they will.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.660
What should I do?

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.300
Don't worry.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.180
I will always be on your side.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.140
It's two against two.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.820
What next?

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.860
When you give birth,

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.220
we'll have three people.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.180
Three against two.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.300
You're going to win with this?

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:06.940
Yes.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.060
Then, we'll keep giving birth.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.460
A crowded tactic.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.540
We'll go three against two,

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.540
four against two, and five against two.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.180
We'll give birth to a basketball team
while chasing for a football team.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.550
- What do you think?
- Do you want to exhaust me to death?

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.900
But I believe

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.780
the baby can overcome every difficulty.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.700
Baby,

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.780
we'll depend on you in the future

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.740
to please your grandparents.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.620
Well,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.020
life is really amazing.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.500
Our genes are passed on
through the chromosomes in our cells

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.340
but it is also an individual

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.940
who has their own thoughts.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.140
Perhaps he won't listen to us at all
in the future.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.060
It's highly possible.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.300
Just like me.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.140
I'll hit his butt.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.020
Don't do it.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.620
Dear,

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.380
you mustn't do that.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.740
Give the baby a name.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.420
I've thought about it.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.180
If we give birth to a boy,

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.740
we'll call him Xiangru.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.860
If we give birth to a girl,
we'll call her Yimo.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:12.900
What do you think?

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.540
Xiangru and Yimo.
[*Profound feelings]

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.020
Nice names.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.180
Both contain the water radical

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.340
to show genes.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.860
Back then,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.350
I was the freestyle swimming champion
of Nanzhou University.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.700
My nickname

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.540
of "Wave Jumping White"
isn't just for show.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.940
After getting married,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.740
I have no choice but to stay in bed.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.540
Darn you!

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.420
It's itchy.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.980
(English)
Take note of prenatal education!

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.020
That's right. Prenatal education.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:48.900
Dear,

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:49.980
swimming

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.700
is very good for a pregnant lady.

00:32:52.127 --> 00:32:53.585
Let's go do it one day.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.220
I approve.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.860
As Shackleton

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.980
and his boat
sailed away from Elephant...

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.580
Minghui's English is...

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.220
His English cannot be understood

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.220
by both foreigners

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.500
and Chinese.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.220
Feng Jianqi!

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.420
Do you know English?

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.340
Do you understand?

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.100
It's understand.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.180
Not ander-stand.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.460
Feng Jianqi!

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.020
You can shut up or get out!

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.740
Seriously.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.340
He is fluent when it comes to scolding.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.620
Shen Minghui,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.140
return me my red packet.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:41.740
Dear,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.340
I think Minghui is studying.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.740
We shouldn't disturb him.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.220
We must seal our mouths

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.420
and not affect him.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.380
How?

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:58.740
Like this.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.220
No.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.180
What's wrong?

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.740
The safety period isn't over yet.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.940
I know.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.700
I just

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.660
want to kiss you.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.700
I like kissing my wife.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.900
(Shen's Restaurant)

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.740
Tidy up and let's eat.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.420
This time,

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.740
we've completely offended Feng's family.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.620
That's better.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.900
Look at his mother.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.980
She is so arrogant.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.260
Did you see
how she spoke with our daughter?

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.100
Our daughter
hasn't been treated this way

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.300
since she was young.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.620
They aren't married yet.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.820
If they are married,
she will surely suffer.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.180
What should we do?

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.820
The children are getting along well.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.140
We can't just cancel the wedding

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.500
because of this.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.540
What should we do?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.300
What?

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.580
If nothing works, we'll choose a date

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.160
and organize our own wedding.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.620
Yes. Forget about them.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.020
Let's do it ourselves. Right?

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.300
We might even get some gift money back.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.620
Is it about gift money?

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.660
It's about our pride.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.060
I'm telling you.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.660
Having Jianqi stay here is good.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.820
A son-in-law is as good as half a son.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.780
We have nothing to lose.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.950
Yes. His mother is the one
who has lost something.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.620
Not so loud. He's around.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.500
Well...

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.860
Dad. Mom. Good morning.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.380
Why are you up so early?

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.020
Exactly.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.050
Minghui has to go to school
and he's still asleep.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:41.900
He's still asleep?

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.900
Minghui!

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.180
(Happy Today)
Get up! You'll be late!

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.260
Sleep more.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.580
He's late.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.140
I mean

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.780
Jianqi should sleep more.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.620
- Are you hungry?
- Sit.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.340
- I'm okay.
- Let me clean up this place.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.880
- Otherwise, it'll be too dusty.
- Eat.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.420
We have milk

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.380
and soy milk.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.780
What do you like?

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.140
I'm fine with anything.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.140
Let me get it.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.300
- No.
- Let me clean up.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.420
Sit.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.660
Let me get it. Hurry.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.350
You are fine with eating anything?

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.140
Just wait.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.140
Unlike our child.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.340
She's picky.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.100
Come downstairs!

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.220
A poor family raising a rich child.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.020
Here you go.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.340
Did you sleep well last night?

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.180
Was it too cramped?

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:23.980
Not at all.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.540
What's wrong?

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.380
Was the bed too small?

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.540
I'm organizing these materials.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.660
Let me make some changes to the bed.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.060
I'll make it wider.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.260
- Yes.
- I'll make a big bed for you.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.940
Good idea.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.260
You're getting him a bigger bed?

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.020
Is he leaving?

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.540
What?

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.340
Yes! Your brother-in-law is staying here.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.660
Do you have any objections?

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.020
Hello.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.060
Hello.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.740
I want all of these.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.340
All right.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.780
(JR Watches)

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.700
(Company forever,
Love and time will always be together)

00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:16.543
Yang,

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.380
help me check in the guests.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:18.980
Sure.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.560
- Do you have a reservation?
- I don't.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.380
We have a twin room and a double room.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.540
Which one do you need?

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.780
Give me a twin room.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.460
Sure.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.060
Two people?

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.060
Yes. Just a child.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.020
- Mingzhu.
- Show me your ID.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:28.340
Mingzhu.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:28.660
OK.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:29.540
All right.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.340
If there are ordinary guests,

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.580
just let them deal with them.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.700
When you are free,

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.860
you should rest more.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.300
Leave early after work.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.460
It's fine, Mr. Zhao.
I don't feel tired at all.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.660
Moreover, I'll go back
with Jianqi at night.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.420
That's great.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.740
I also have another thing to tell you.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.500
Mr. Feng

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.940
has transferred

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.060
all the receptionists to Nanxi Hotel.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.660
He said

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.700
he doesn't want promotions

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.500
or vouchers.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.450
He only said one thing.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.060
Take good care of Shen Mingzhu.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.980
Is that so?

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.940
I came to you

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.900
to tell you

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.540
that you must thank Mr. Feng

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.220
when you go back.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.780
One more thing.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.180
If it's convenient,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.700
help me put in a good word

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.820
to Mr. Feng about our hotel.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.180
It's tough doing this business.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.060
All the mid-level executives

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.780
are stressed about sales.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.540
I understand. Don't worry.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.820
I'll come to you for top-ups.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.060
See? No wonder you can marry a rich man.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.260
You have a high EQ.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.940
I'll go back to work then.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.540
Sure.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.980
Rest more.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.580
Sure.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.940
Everyone is busy.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.500
Is everyone eating lunchboxes again?

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.500
Yes.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.980
I won't be ordering today.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.140
I've prepared a feast.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.460
A feast?

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.820
It's a feast indeed.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.380
This is a good lunchbox.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.380
My father-in-law opens a restaurant.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.500
He prepared them for me.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.300
I also want a father-in-law like him.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.340
Count me in.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.300
Sorry, you are late.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.660
My father-in-law

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.340
only has one daughter.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.700
She's Mrs. Feng now.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.700
Feng married the daughter
of a restaurant owner.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.140
Ever since,

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.100
he has achieved the pinnacle in life.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.700
Let us try it as well.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.620
Next time.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.060
This is specially made

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.340
by my father-in-law.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.580
Are you trying to tease us on purpose?

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.540
How is it? Is it delicious?

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.020
It's incredible.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.700
(Forever in our memories )

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.020
Mom,

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.060
if you have any clues,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.100
remember to tell me in my dreams.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.780
Hello.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.900
Yes.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.060
Yes. We are looking for someone.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.820
You are...

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.940
Our caretakers

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.300
are very experienced.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.340
Our VIP wards and the delivery room
are combined.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.780
We have constant temperature, humidity,
and also a constant level of care.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.660
Our postpartum caregiver
is also working around the clock.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.900
They can provide the utmost care

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.180
to the baby and his mother.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.660
Well...

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.740
Can you give me

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.300
the premium pregnancy set's information

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.020
to me?

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:36.580
Sure.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.100
Thank you.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.980
Give me the information
on the premium abortion set

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.020
as well.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.220
We don't need that.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.740
Are you the one giving birth?

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.980
You'll give birth
and I'll raise the baby.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.180
Get a bigger house for the baby then.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.300
How is that related to this?

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.740
The baby is young.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.820
He won't mind.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.860
The big baby, Jiao, cares about that.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.140
She needs her own space.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.280
Why don't we do it like this?

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.580
You'll raise the child.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.900
I'll take Jiao

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:22.820
and find her

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.620
a father who can provide us
with a big house.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.380
Can you get me another glass of water?

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.220
Sure.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.740
This has nothing to do

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.220
with finding a father

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.440
who can get her a bigger house?

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.820
Does Jiao need another father?

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.380
Jiao needs a dog.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.820
Don't you need space to keep a dog?

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.380
You do.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.060
I still need to find a father
who can get me a big house.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.920
Why do you insist
on finding another father?

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.840
How about finding another mother?

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.020
I can't bear losing you.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:52.980
I can't.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.460
(Premium Abortion Set,
Premium Pregnancy Set)

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.540
See? Giving birth
and not giving birth are both expensive.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.300
This depends on

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.350
where the scale of your love
is tipping toward.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.260
Not giving birth is cheaper.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.100
Let's go to the market.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.980
There's a sale on eggs today.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.900
You're so annoying.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.180
Hello.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.460
They found...

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.980
They found your younger sister!

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.780
She's in Guangzhou.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.620
She'll come back tomorrow.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.780
I gave her 3,000 yuan
in transportation fees.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.540
Congratulations.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.180
