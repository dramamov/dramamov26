Oh, Miss Su,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.280
you need to call out louder.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.799
Otherwise,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.240
how will you attract customers?

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.679
I need to go home for more flour.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:38.880
You stay here and keep selling.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.679
If any customers come,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.200
just handle it yourself.

Give me two buns.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.079
Sorry, sorry.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.920
Sorry, you dropped everything on the ground.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.280
And you still want me to buy?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.760
Sorry, is this how you do business?

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:10.920
You...

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.840
My buns...

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:13.120
Sorry, boss.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.840
Sorry.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.319
What's wrong with you?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.040
I...

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.640
I was gone for just a moment,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.319
and you ruined a whole basket of buns.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.920
I didn't know the steamer was so hot.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.599
You've never eaten pork

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.640
but you've seen pigs run, right?

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.079
Can't even pick up a bun properly.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.400
My humble shop can't handle someone like you.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.879
Just go.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.439
Boss...

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.359
What about my wages?

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.079
I'm not even asking you to pay for the loss.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480
And you still want your wages?

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.799
Leave before I change my mind.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.480
Wait.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.680
Leave the apron.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.079
What kind of person is this?

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.280
My buns...

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.319
Perfectly good buns, all ruined.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.079
Madam Boss,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.799
Mr. Xie,

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.879
That young lady is an old friend of mine.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.920
Really?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920
Please, don't be upset.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.719
Her family has fallen on hard times.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.120
That's why she's working here.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.120
Please be understanding.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.079
I have one more favor to ask.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.519
Go ahead.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.799
I hope you can

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.280
let her keep working here.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.240
I'll pay her wages.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.120
But don't tell her.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.639
Is that alright?

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.439
Well...

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.439
Since Mr. Xie asked,

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.159
then I

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.599
will go get her to come back and help.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.639
Thank you.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.439
I'll go right now.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.759
Lady Su,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.599
Lady Su,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.879
Please wait.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.280
Boss, why are you here?

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.840
I can't pay for your buns.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.520
Miss Su, you've misunderstood.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.800
I'm not here for compensation.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.599
Then why are you here?

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.520
I was wrong earlier.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
I spoke too harshly.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520
Please don't take it to heart.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.840
Come back to work.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.199
No need.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.120
Since you already sent me away,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.240
I'll just find work elsewhere.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.960
Lady Su,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.439
If you insist on leaving,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.879
there's a stable hiring in East Jincheng.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.199
You can work there.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.319
Thank you.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.759
You're welcome.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.879
Strange, just told me to leave,

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.000
now wants me to stay.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.319
Boss...

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.080
Are you hiring?

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.919
Yes, I am.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.039
But I raise horses here.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.599
I know how, let me try.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.319
Alright.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.520
Horse...

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.439
Are you remembering

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.039
the world you once knew?

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.840
Alright.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.159
I'll take you out for a walk.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.840
I was wondering...

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.759
I haven't seen you all afternoon.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.039
So you were slacking off here.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.280
Boss, I wasn't slacking off.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.040
The horse's been in the stable too long,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.480
so I took it out for some air.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.720
Only this way

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.079
can the horse stay healthy and shiny.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.920
You're just a hired hand.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.120
This is my horse.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.240
Who let you take it out?

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.720
Just feed the horse well,

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.920
it'll stay healthy.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.839
A walk, really?

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.079
You think you know horses better than me?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.079
Boss, you've misunderstood.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.079
For over ten years,

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.800
I've spent a hundred days a year with horses.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.000
I'm not trying to explain.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.199
I just hope you can trust me.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.879
I'll make your horse

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.279
stand out from the rest.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.519
Don't come back. Leave.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.279
If Boss Yang hadn't recommended her,

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.680
I wouldn't have hired her.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.399
She's clearly spoiled.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.319
Boss...

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.680
I heard she's Princess Royal Su Feng'er.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.879
Is it really okay for us to treat her like this?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.560
Even if she's Princess Royal,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.639
she's been demoted to commoner now.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.079
She's just earning a living like everyone else.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.079
Heard she messed up Boss Yang's bun shop

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:38.399
and left it in a mess.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.120
At this rate,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.439
Jincheng won't have a place for her soon.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.600
Let's go.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.480
Princess, why are you still awake?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.600
Xiao Tao,

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.199
do you think I'm completely useless?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.000
You are the Princess Royal of Jincheng,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.879
the Ever-Victorious General praised by the people.

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.519
Why would you say such a thing?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
Princess Royal and Ever-Victorious General—

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.439
those are all things of the past.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.480
Now I can't even sell buns properly.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.600
Even my best skill, riding, isn't respected.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.079
Tell me, what else can I do?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.839
When I first entered the palace,

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.600
I didn't know anything either.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.480
I was careless in everything I did.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:43.600
I remember once I accidentally broke a mirror.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.319
Du Mama scolded me for it.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.279
But you, Princess, defended me.

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.639
You transferred me to the Princess's residence.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.120
If you hadn't mentioned it,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.879
I'd have forgotten how you first arrived.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.879
But I will always remember.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.680
From that moment on,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.480
I swore to do everything well.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.519
To repay your great kindness.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.519
Didn't it prove later

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.839
that as long as you try,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.920
one day the clouds will part and the sun will shine.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.600
Alright.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.839
Then I, Princess Royal, will do my best in everything.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.079
That's the Princess I believe in.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.720
Princess Feng'er lives among the people.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.000
Ordinary folks find it novel.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.240
They don't care about her title.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.319
They only see Feng'er unable to help.

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.600
She has no royal airs at all.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.079
She holds thousands of families in her heart.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:34.720
In her heart.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.600
Little one,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.480
can you show me?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.160
Sure, okay.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.680
Give me one.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.920
I want one too.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.839
Give me, give me.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.040
You want one too?

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:46.600
Alright.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.040
Remember what the teacher taught you.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.639
Here, yours.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:53.920
I want one too.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.600
Remember.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.720
Here.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.959
You want one too?

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.839
I want one, you want one.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.040
I want one too.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.639
Give me.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.959
Brother, I want one too.
