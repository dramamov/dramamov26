00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.440
This way.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.840
Second Miss, the person is here.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.960
My father is already inside waiting for you.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.520
Father.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080
Jin Shisan greets Yang Ba Ye.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
Only outsiders call me Ba Ye.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.560
Your father and I share a bond of life and death.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.200
Calling me Ba Ye feels too distant.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.960
Sit.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.360
Ba Ye.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.840
Then how should I address you?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.680
Just call me Uncle for now.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.520
Alright.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.640
Uncle.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.800
Jin Shisan pays respects to Uncle.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.800
Good.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.360
Uncle.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.040
About your health...

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.040
I know my own body.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.120
I won't see next year.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.720
I remember my father once said,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.160
using knotweed,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.160
asarum,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.440
and blue salt,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.840
combined with ginseng in medicine,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.120
can strengthen the body.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080
It can cure strange illnesses of energy.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.360
Only knotweed is hard to find in Songling Town.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.680
But I recall a small stream on the southern slope.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.840
At this time of year,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.080
it should be possible to harvest some.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.840
I've never been to the southern slope.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.080
I'm not familiar with it.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.440
How about this—

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.680
Ruyi,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.680
ask your brother to go into the mountains alone.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.560
Let him gather some knotweed.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.520
It'll help him practice his skills.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.520
Alright.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.760
And give us some time alone.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.720
Let me and him talk privately.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.480
Okay.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.760
You two go ahead and talk.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.440
Shisan,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.440
you've seen it yourself.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.440
My time is almost up.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.080
Before I die, there are two things I can't let go.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.560
I must entrust them to you.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.280
Uncle, please tell me.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.840
The first thing—

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.600
is my unmarried daughter.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.840
I'm unlucky; my son turned out useless.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.840
Ruyi, as a daughter,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.760
has weathered storms all these years.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.760
She has held this family together alone.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.560
It's not been easy.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.560
My old bones have burdened her.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.200
When I'm gone someday,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840
I'm afraid she'll be alone,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.680
bullied in the Ginseng Guild.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.320
Uncle.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.040
I promise you.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.960
The second thing is—

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.840
the same knot in both our hearts.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.480
The Jin family massacre.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.680
Back then, Old Jin, Duan Laojiu, and I

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.480
were all reckless men in our twenties.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.040
There was a rumor—

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.560
that in Changbai Mountain, there's a Priceless Ginseng King.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.560
Eat it, and you gain immortality.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.680
Its cave is called the Celestial Grotto.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.480
Only those with the Nine Immortals' Compass

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.280
and the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.120
can find the Ginseng King.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.840
And claim the treasures and immortality within.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.480
The compass has been passed down in the Jin family.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.200
But the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.320
has never been found by generations of mountain men.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.400
I never thought you'd uncover it.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.960
So that's how it is.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.560
It was all Duan Laojiu's scheme.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960
You know everything now.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.320
I just found out myself.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.560
The Celestial Temple three years ago—

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.400
it was all Duan Laojiu's doing.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.760
Not just three years.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400
Duan Laojiu planned this scheme

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.920
for a full twenty years.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.960
Shisan.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400
When you were young,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.320
your family had more than

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.960
just this old house, right?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.320
The Jin family were mountain experts.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.320
They amassed many treasures and antiques.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.720
Where did they all go?

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.480
Why are you all squeezed into

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.040
this shabby old house now?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.280
Uncle, do you know the reason?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.760
Old Jin was too honest, too naive.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.280
He didn't have Duan Laojiu's cunning.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.320
The ginseng shop business

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.320
was ruined and taken by Duan Laojiu.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.160
Half of his current fortune

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.320
was once your Jin family's.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.320
Old leader.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.320
That's all, right?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.280
The silver notes have been checked.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.000
Once handed over, no debts are recognized.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.200
That's it. All gone.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.320
Let's go.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.280
Father.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.720
Is something troubling you?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.000
Why sigh so deeply?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.320
You don't know shit.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.680
This is an ancestral breathing technique.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.000
I'll teach you later.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.000
What are you staring at?

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.440
It's mealtime, why aren't you eating?

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.400
Don't you have a pocket watch?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.600
Why ask me the time?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.440
Lost it.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.440
Old Jin was so stubborn.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.760
I lent him money to help.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.960
He just wouldn't accept it.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.720
Duan Laojiu forced him into a corner.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.600
Finally, he showed his true colors.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.160
He wanted Old Jin to trade the Nine Immortals' Compass for his property.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.720
Old Jin refused.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.600
And right at that moment,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.960
the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng was rumored to appear.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.720
Old Jin returned to the mountains.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.880
He wanted to unearth the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.320
To find the Celestial Grotto and restore his family.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.600
But none of us expected—

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.320
Duan Laojiu would be so ruthless.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.720
When he couldn't buy the compass,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.200
he killed your whole family at the Celestial Temple.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.040
Uncle.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.720
The funny thing is,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.960
Lin Lao Qi got the Nine Immortals' Compass
for nothing.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.040
The teams sent to the mountain

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.880
never found the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.320
The Duan and Lin families are lying low,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600
waiting for the right moment.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.040
I've lived like a coward all this time,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.560
afraid to avenge the Jin family.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
Scared I can't beat Duan Laojiu,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.600
and drag my children down with me.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.440
I've been hiding here for three years.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.720
Enough.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.160
Now that you're back,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.960
the Yang Ginseng Guild is your support.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.320
I want to see you avenge the Jin family
before I die.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.600
Here, Uncle.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.320
Have some water.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.440
Fresh hot noodle soup, just made.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.280
It's steaming.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.160
Jin Shisan.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.440
Just a little thing.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.440
What are you thinking about?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.000
You haven't said a word since dinner started.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.600
It's nothing.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.320
Are you free?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.280
Let's take a walk.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.720
You two got weird after your talk.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.280
Uncle just told me some old stories,

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.440
asked me to look after you.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.280
To protect you like a sister.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.600
Like a sister?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.000
Why a sister?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.680
Is that what you want, or my father's idea?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.720
Yang Ruyi.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.440
Jin Shisan.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.720
I like you.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.440
You know that.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.160
I don't have anything else on my mind now.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.960
Okay.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.200
I understand.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160
I like you.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.000
It's not to make you like me back.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.320
I just wanted to tell you.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.440
Let's leave it at that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.960
Let's go our separate ways.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.960
Dad

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.400
Jin Shisan is getting closer to the truth.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.640
But Jin Shisan doesn't understand

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.720
Lin Qi Ye, Duan Laojiu

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.640
why your most trusted brother

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.840
would want you dead.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.520
In this Ginseng Guild,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.960
what are the real rules?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.080
What is true honor?

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.360
Dad

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.480
I swear

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.600
how Duan Laojiu hurt you back then,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.720
I'll make him pay for every bit of it.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.520
Dad

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.400
All these years, you've suffered injustice

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.840
without a chance to clear your name.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.720
Heaven has been unfair to you,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.280
and to our Jin family.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.160
For you, and for the Jin family,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.040
Jin Shisan will demand justice from the heavens.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.160
Jinzi

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.720
Baobao

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.160
Chief Luo

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:36.960
You're back.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.040
Was there anything fun in the capital?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Did you bring anything tasty

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.040
for me and Jin Shisan?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.960
All you think about is food.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.160
We were traveling nonstop, no time for that.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.280
On my way back from the capital,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.280
I passed by Yejiling.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.960
I found something strange.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.720
What was it?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.280
There's a ravine east of Yejiling.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.160
I found a pile of white bones there.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.240
Looks like they've been dead a long time.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400
Bones?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.160
All human skeletons.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.160
There were seven or eight in total.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.280
That's creepy.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.600
Chief Luo,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.960
I'll get a fire basin ready for you.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.520
Jump over it

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.280
to ward off bad luck.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040
That forest is thick.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.840
Few ginseng pickers go in there.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.600
If I hadn't taken a shortcut this time,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.040
cutting through the middle,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.160
I wouldn't have found it at all.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.160
In that forest,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.280
there aren't any wild beasts, right?

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.280
This seems suspicious.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.800
Baobao,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.040
tell the Blood Servant brothers

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.960
to stay alert these days.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.600
Uncle Luo,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.640
thanks for making the trip.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.480
It was hard on you.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.040
No need to be polite.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.400
It's just a trip.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.280
No big deal.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.360
For the Jin family,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.280
for the chief,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.160
anything is worth doing.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.840
There's one more thing,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.480
I'll need you to make another trip.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.400
Just tell me where to go.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.400
I'll head out right away.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.160
No rush, no rush.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.600
A couple days ago,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.160
I sent Haiyue back home.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.040
She should be back today.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.160
Let's wait for her and discuss together.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.160
Alright.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.040
Brother Jin,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.400
when will Haiyue be back?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.720
She's been gone for days.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.160
Is she coming back today?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.840
You miss her, don't you?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.080
I don't miss her.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.160
Why would I miss her?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.160
I, uh...

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.840
I'm just worried she'll delay your business.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.600
Jin Shisan,

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.720
I'm back!

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.040
Haiyue!

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:14.960
Help me with this.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.720
Why do you only call Jin Shisan, not me?

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.160
Look,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.160
you've lost weight.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.840
Jin Shisan,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.600
let me tell you,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.400
I closed a big deal this time.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.840
Glad it went smoothly.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.720
Haiyue is really impressive.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.400
By the way,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.040
I brought you some snacks from the capital.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.600
Put them away quickly.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.160
Don't let that kid eat them all.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.160
Wait—

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.080
Brother Luo, that's not fair.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.600
You give her treats, not me?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.840
Here, here, here—take some.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.720
I knew you were a foodie.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.920
Alright, alright, alright.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.720
Your Uncle Luo

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.040
just got back from the capital.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.600
He brought you treats

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.840
and lots of fun stories.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.640
Let him tell you about it.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.960
The capital is lively.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.920
Roast duck is popular there.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.960
They roast the duck in an oven.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.280
Then slice it after roasting.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.920
Dip the slices in sauce.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.960
Wrap it in a pancake after dipping.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.160
The taste—

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.600
not as good as our smoked meat pancakes.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.720
Chief Luo,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.600
I heard there's something called douzhi in the capital.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.280
It's like our tofu here,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.160
but left to spoil.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.160
It turns into a liquid.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.840
It's really sour.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.280
No, no, no, that's awful.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.040
Really, it's terrible.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.840
Let me tell you,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.080
Miss Yang still hasn't changed

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.240
her habit of peeking at people.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.960
There's a treat called "Rolling Donkey," soft and sweet.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:25.960
I'm telling you,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.280
When will you start calling me Ruyi?

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.960
Come sit inside.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.720
No need.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.720
I just came to tell you

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.160
I'll be heading to Fengtian in a few days.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.240
To handle some Ginseng Shop business.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.040
How long will you be gone?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.800
Can't bear to see me leave?

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.920
I'll be quick, back soon.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.640
You're still recovering.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.040
Don't overwork yourself.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.720
Not bad,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.280
you've learned to care for others.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.160
Jin Shisan,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.160
wait for me to return.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.280
Duan Laojiu

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.400
This is our Ginseng Guild's
account book for this month.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.960
Eun Hee

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.080
About this bonsai here,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.600
it needs trimming
from time to time.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.600
That way, it won't
grow crooked.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.160
What a pity.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840
This one grew crooked.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.480
The whole pot is ruined.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.400
Take it out.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:28.920
Throw it away.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.840
Yes.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.600
Duan Laojiu, you truly
have a sharp eye.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.840
How are those Ginseng Guilds
in Fengtian lately?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.160
Ever since Liuhe Tang
and Jin Shisan

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.040
opened ten Ginseng Guilds
in Fengtian,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.040
it's had quite an impact
on our business.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.040
And with Liuhe Tang backing them,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040
many ginseng suppliers
who worked with us

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.040
now switched to
working with Jin Shisan.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.360
This branch is crooked too.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.720
Duan Laojiu,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.640
I heard that lately,
Jin Shisan

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.840
landed a big order.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.160
All his Ginseng Guilds

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.720
are buying wild ginseng
in bulk.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.160
And they're offering
above market price,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.480
paying twenty percent more.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.600
Choi Haiyue even went back
to Joseon

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.080
just for this ginseng deal.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.040
Then we should help

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.080
this promising young
Boss Jin.
