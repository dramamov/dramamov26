One of the things

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.810
I've deceived you about

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.750
is that I never told you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.670
that I'm better at poison-making

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.810
than practicing medicine.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.830
Medicine and poison
have been inseparable.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.960
Miss Song and you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.800
are so close.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.870
Didn't she tell you this?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.340
(Youban Pavilion)

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.640
Take care of them.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.750
Yes.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.410
Don't blame me.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.150
If I hadn't left myself a way out

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.730
in front of you today,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.680
my life

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.520
would truly be

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520
in your hands tonight.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.310
Do you remember?

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.310
When we first met,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.310
you kindly saved me,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.910
who deliberately got close to you,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.190
allowing me to take root

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.310
in Huajing City.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.870
Now, it's time for me

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.280
to repay you.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.590
If I had known,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.630
I should've killed you back then.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.310
You won't.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.470
You've toiled for Great Sui

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.190
for decades.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.400
It's time for you to rest.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.430
Starting tomorrow,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.520
I will take over your mansion.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.190
Rest assured.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.400
I will thoroughly clean up

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.150
those who should not stay

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.840
for you.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.840
How dare you!

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.400
Keep an eye on her.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.150
Yes.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.220
Last time in Qinxi Valley,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.420
Gu Chusheng almost exposed

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.100
Yao Yong's meeting with the assassins.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.460
I managed to make the assassins appear,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.220
forcing Yao Yong to act,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.620
pinning all the blame

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.820
on him.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.540
Then I risked my life to save Changming,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.400
which made her let her guard down

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.900
against me.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.460
But this time...

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.500
It seems I underestimated

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.740
Chu Yu and Wei Yun.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.580
With just a note,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.780
they have cornered me like this.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.200
Though you've controlled

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.480
the Eldest Princess for now,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.740
it won't be long

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.660
before someone else here finds out.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.380
If Changming doesn't show up for long,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.030
others will surely get suspicious.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.490
Yao Yong is dead,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.370
Shen You has disappeared,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.860
and all my left and right arms

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.120
in Great Sui have been cut off.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.060
We can't stay

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.660
in Great Sui anymore.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.300
Why don't you

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.820
just kill the Eldest Princess?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.580
Using her death as a reason

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.820
to disperse the attendants,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.460
you can easily slip away.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.900
She's more useful when she's alive.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.820
With the city under martial law,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.180
she's the only way

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.100
to get Emperor Chunde's decree

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.820
and leave Huajing smoothly.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.920
Also, if we keep her as a hostage

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.800
in North Qi,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.740
it'll also do us good.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.900
But now,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.620
Chu Yu and Wei Yun's attention

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.580
might still be here.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.540
It won't be easy for you

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.460
to take

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.740
the Eldest Princess away.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.500
Then let's create some trouble for them,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.180
making them busy,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.260
and we will have a chance to escape.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.340
However,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.780
this plan is not foolproof.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.780
If they see through it,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.900
neither of us will get away safely.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.240
If you hadn't saved me,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.500
I would've died at the hands

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.780
of the Eldest Princess long ago.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.440
For your life-saving grace,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.180
I'm willing to repay with my life.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.180
You're the best to me.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.700
I will never abandon you

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.520
unless it's absolutely necessary.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.100
Shen You really has

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.340
a lot of patience.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.720
We've been waiting here

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.460
for days,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.220
yet he hasn't done anything.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.420
He probably has discovered

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.580
our presence,

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.340
so he dares not act rashly.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.300
This stalemate

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.380
isn't getting us anywhere.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.820
(Ruyi Inn)

- Move!

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.020
- Fire!
- Move!

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.980
Make way!

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.060
Fire!

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.060
- Help!
- Fire!

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.900
Fire!

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.900
My Lady,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.540
since we already know

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.860
that man is a North Qi spy,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.060
why bother going there?

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.180
No.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.980
If I don't visit him

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.300
as usual,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.060
he will surely get suspicious.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.620
As part of the Wei family,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.740
I have to do something.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.460
Let's go.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.900
Wang Lan.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.620
My Lady, what's wrong?

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.300
My belly...

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.440
Are you about to give birth?

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.460
Go get help.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.380
She once saved me.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.500
How could I harm her?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.340
Go!

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.420
Help!

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.620
Help!

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.180
You...

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.020
You can't leave.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.620
Don't worry; I won't leave.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.180
Ms. Wang,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.180
try to relax

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.720
and breathe out slowly.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.660
I use this method when I'm in pain.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.020
It always works.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.140
Ms. Wang.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.220
Shen You, let go of Ms. Wang.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.180
If you insist on capturing me,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.340
Ms. Wang

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.340
and the child in her womb

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.180
will not be safe.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.060
You...

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.580
The choice is yours.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.860
You can't leave.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.500
My Lady,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.740
are you alright?

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.980
Help!

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.620
My Lady.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.980
My Lady.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.900
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.260
Chun, why look so worried?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.020
Does Lingshu look heinous

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.140
and scare you?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.860
Stop joking.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.380
If Wei Qiu and a clinic

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.180
hadn't been nearby,

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.060
you and this child

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.500
would've been in danger.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.700
Chun, don't worry.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.640
Lan escaped death this time.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.580
Great fortune will surely follow.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.500
Yu,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.780
I heard from Lisheng

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.420
that after Wei Qiu came back,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.420
he received military punishment.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.500
It's my fault

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.940
this time.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.780
I was too reckless.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.100
It's not Wei Qiu's fault.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.260
Please, Yu,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.420
talk to Yun for me,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.580
and ask him not to blame Wei Qiu.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.940
Don't worry.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.880
Even if you don't say it,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.420
Yun must know in his heart.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.260
I think Lingshu

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.020
has eyes just like Rong.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.940
But his mouth

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.100
is extremely similar to Lan's.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.820
Come on, let me hold him.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.620
Be careful.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.980
How is Lan?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.540
Your Lordship,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.720
both of them are safe.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.100
The physician said

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.020
that although Ms. Wang is fine,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.580
she has been frightened

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.660
and needs to recover for a while.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.760
Why not look at her before you leave?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.400
Lingling has been crying out

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.440
to see her sister.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.100
Since you came first,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.300
you get the privilege
of seeing her first.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.980
Lingshu, look.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.500
This is Uncle.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.940
Your uncle.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.420
I know your uncle

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.780
has been planning

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.780
to use Shen You to expose

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.460
the man behind him.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.260
Unfortunately,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.700
he escaped this time.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.340
Your uncle must be very upset,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.540
right?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.320
Shen You is related
to the octagonal crossbow.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.840
Now that he escaped,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.860
your clue met a dead end.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.500
Wei Qiu

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.700
did his best in that situation.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.640
- I don't want to punish him.
- I know.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.880
You did the right thing.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.940
If I were you,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.660
I would have done the same.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.420
And I know

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.000
you've long regarded Wei Qiu

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.140
as your brother.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.780
I believe

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.940
you won't let it end like this.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.980
Shen You must still be in Huajing.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.420
I'll seek permission now

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.340
to seal off the city.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.860
Yu,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.660
thanks for talking to me like this.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.740
What for?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.740
When have we

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.380
ever needed to be so polite?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.300
Do you want a hug?

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.580
Here?

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.620
Isn't it a bit too brazen?

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.060
Hold Lingshu.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.820
What are you thinking?

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.300
Come on.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.620
Be careful.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.260
Be careful.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.980
Lingshu.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.900
Look, this is Uncle.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.420
Lingshu is crying.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.780
It's all your fault.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.460
Mr. Xue.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.900
Mr. Xue.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.540
Mr. Xue.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.100
Wei Yun's men followed me too closely.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.260
I barely managed to escape.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.620
Please spare my life.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.780
Have mercy, please.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.180
You're the leader of my elite agents,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.260
yet you failed to kill

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.100
a weak scholar

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.780
and almost got captured.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.620
What use are you to me?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.740
Mr. Xue,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.980
I've run out of antidotes.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.480
If it weren't for desperation,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.580
how dare I come to see you?

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.140
Rest assured.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.180
No one knows

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.060
I came here.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.700
I promise.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.300
I won't fail next time;

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.620
otherwise,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.140
I will take my own life.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.300
If I hadn't controlled you with poison,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.300
wouldn't you have gone to Wei Yun

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.140
and betrayed me?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.140
I dare not.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.820
I am loyal.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.760
How could I betray you?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.780
Please, give me the antidote.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.100
I can't bear the pain anymore.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.180
Chu Yu and Wei Yun

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.020
are suspicious now.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.600
We can't wait any longer.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.300
We must immediately proceed

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.480
to the next step of the plan.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.780
So, what do you plan to do?

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.420
Xiang will take care of it.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.420
Next,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.500
there will be a good show.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.500
The Emperor's order:

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.700
Seal the city gates now.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.140
Yes.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.860
Close the gates.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.340
(Huajing City)

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.040
Your Lordship,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.660
the Xisheng Gate
has also been fortified.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.660
Shall we take a look?

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.900
It's him, right?

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.740
Yes.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.740
Let's go.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.590
That figure...

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.780
It really is him.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.020
This woman...

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.660
What are you holding?

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.060
I...

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.660
(Romance of the Marquis)

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.500
(Romance of the Marquis)

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.940
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.540
let me tell you a story

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.460
of a rare and extraordinary tale.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.060
(Wei Yun, Chu Yu)

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.180
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.940
Chun.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.980
Yu,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.520
this is the most popular novel
in Huajing now.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.080
(Romance of the Marquis)
It's said to be based on you and Yun.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.300
(Romance of the Marquis)

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.420
Although

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.460
you suddenly joined our family,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.020
you have shown deep affection

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.340
and loyalty to our family lately.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.580
I admire you

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.580
greatly.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.460
In my eyes,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.740
you are clear-headed

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.580
and strong.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.340
You should know what to do

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.500
and what not to do.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.220
Chun,

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.820
are you reminding me?

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.060
No.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.820
It's already a done deal.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.260
Everyone in Huajing

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.660
has known about this.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.460
I only have one question.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.060
When did it start?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.460
When Jun was alive...

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.300
No.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.100
There was nothing
between Wei Jun and me.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.920
The feelings between Wei Yun and me

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.300
may not be accepted by the world,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.180
but there is no trace of indecency.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.860
Since you know it's not accepted
by the world,

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.980
why haven't you stopped it?

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.740
Can I just stop my feelings

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.220
if I want to?

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.700
Don't you know

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.260
who you are

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.500
to Wei Yun?

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.780
Though it is a chaotic era now,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.420
what people value most

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.620
is still reputation.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.260
Even if I believe

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.860
that the affection between you two

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.920
started after Jun's death,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.100
what about others?

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.580
Now this novel has caused

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.020
a stir throughout Huajing City.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.340
Yu,

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.520
you may not care about your reputation,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.620
but our family has to.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.340
In fact, Yun has given me
the divorce paper.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.460
We have been discussing

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.580
when to tell everyone,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.160
but fate has played us.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.700
We failed to hide it from anyone.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.740
In fact, our relationship

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.580
is never incestuous.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.160
We just don't follow proper procedures.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.260
Though it is indecent in your eyes,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.660
we haven't hurt anyone.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.500
Why should we be so wronged

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.100
for a relationship?

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.420
Why don't you take another path

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.700
and find another man?

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.020
Chun, you've always been

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.020
diligent and responsible

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.660
in managing our family.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.260
I chose to live here as a widow,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.340
guarding our family,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.580
because Mother handed me

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.140
the family jade pendant.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.220
From that moment on,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.060
I was not just myself anymore.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.820
So,

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.700
don't hate me.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.420
Of course.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.020
I can understand.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.260
I love him,

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.980
and I want to be with him.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.860
I never felt that this relationship

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.740
was wrong to others,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.460
because I only value reason,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.940
not ritual teaching.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.300
But I never mean

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.180
to hurt others.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.580
I can understand

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.640
what you are worried about.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.340
Don't worry.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.420
I will surely give you an explanation.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.060
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.500
My Lady,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.740
what about His Lordship?

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.780
Shall we not inform him?

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.580
Let it be.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.500
I will do my business,

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.120
and I will see him when I want to.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.860
I'm just not

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.060
Wei Jun's wife anymore.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.580
I'm not giving him up.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.700
This rumor is very suspicious.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.520
I need to go back
to the Chu Mansion first.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.180
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.340
Where is she?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.580
She's left.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.340
Stop.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.980
If you truly care for her,

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.140
stay here today.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:51.860
Chun,

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.940
this matter can be resolved.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.300
Resolve what?

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.860
The rumors,

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.620
or the feelings between you two?

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.180
You already know it?

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.680
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.380
what could this novel

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.740
decide?

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.580
Yun,

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.020
you are still young.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.300
So what?

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.780
Because I'm young,

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.500
my love for someone

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.380
isn't real?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.820
And I can't have what I want,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.820
just because you say so,

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.220
right?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.460
But she is your sister-in-law.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.900
She is not my real sister-in-law.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.620
There was never any true affection

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.500
between Jun and her.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.740
That's nonsense!

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.580
Chun,

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.460
I truly

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.980
love Chu Yu.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.420
I used

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.380
to be troubled by it.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.880
I've endured it for so long.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.620
I thought

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.580
that I could just

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.900
keep this feeling to myself,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.340
but

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.900
I can't.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.100
We've laid the groundwork,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.280
- but...
- Wei Yun,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.460
your father and elder brothers

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.360
sacrificed their lives

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.920
to earn our family's honor.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.940
Your mother,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.380
to defend the family's reputation,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.820
chose death over disgrace.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.820
And you?

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.580
Do you even know

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.940
that you are part of our family?

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.740
Lisheng.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.620
(Tablet of Wei Jun, General Zhongwu)

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.500
I have reminded you

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.900
time and again

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.380
that you are no longer a young master,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:50.820
no longer the boy

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.340
who is pampered and loved.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.140
You are the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.260
When you violate the family rules,

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.900
you should be disciplined

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.380
as a warning to others.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.500
Stop right there.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.500
Today, unless you kill me,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.260
I will go to see her.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.220
Do you have to make it so hard for me?

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.540
(Tablet of Wei Jun, General Zhongwu)

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.340
Jun knew everything.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.700
I'll still accept the punishment.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.500
But if you want me to give up Chu Yu,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.260
I can't do it.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.720
Since you want to discipline me,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.880
I might as well do it myself.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.500
Wei Qiu,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.460
bring the family whip.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.900
(Tablet of Wei Jun, General Zhongwu)

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:15.980
Your Lordship...

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.820
The Marquis hereby orders:

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.280
According to the family rules,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.040
I disrespected my elder brother

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.320
and brought shame to my family.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.500
I deserve 99 lashes.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.100
Your Lordship,

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.220
your wounds have just healed.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.660
Wei Qiu,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.540
start now!

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.580
Regardless of my status,

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.980
I've developed feelings for Chu Yu.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.740
This is my first mistake.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.100
I couldn't restrain my feelings

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.500
and wanted to disturb her.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.860
This is my second mistake.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.220
I admired her

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.260
but couldn't protect her.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.140
This is my third mistake.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.500
But I love her

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.820
and want to be with her forever.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.340
That's not my fault.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.140
I may have a thousand faults,

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.740
but wanting to be with her

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.700
isn't one of them.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.940
Yun!

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.700
Stop it.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.580
Do you know

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.540
what you will face in the future?

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.580
Do you know

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.220
how much gossip she will face?

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.900
Yun,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.820
fatal knives are not only
on the battlefield.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.180
Those harsh words

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.860
can also kill her.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.060
What's the point of this?

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.260
What can you gain from this?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.260
Don't you understand?

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.020
However pure your feelings are,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.340
they are still considered dirty
in this world.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.740
It's all

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.580
to love her openly and honestly.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.020
From today on,

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.340
I will love her

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.340
with dignity

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.260
and integrity.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.500
Chun,

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.300
no one can stop me.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.100
No one.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.940
Yun...

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.780
Yun!

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.860
(Chu Mansion)

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.340
How shameless!

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.940
Disgracing the family!

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.900
What's going on?

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.220
I have no idea.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.060
So many people.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.580
What are you doing?

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.420
- Stop!
- Stop it!

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.320
- Stop it!
- Stop!

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.820
- Stop!
- Stop it!

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.940
- How could she do this?
- Disgracing the family!

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.780
Everyone, stop!

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.420
This family

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.260
is really shameless.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.580
Look at them.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.140
They don't follow proper conduct.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.540
- Throw!
- Stop!

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.380
Stop it!

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.220
It's her.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.580
- Yu.
- Linyang.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.460
- Stop it!
- Take it out on me!

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.980
Splash her!

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:12.820
Hurry up.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.900
Shameless!

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.740
How despicable!

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.380
How shameless!

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.540
Good.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.820
- Linyang.
- They deserve it.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.260
They deserve it.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.460
Let them splash.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.100
What a jerk!

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.620
- Jin.
- Jin.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.140
- Don't go!
- Fortunately,

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.420
I didn't continue to pursue you.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.280
Such a family

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.820
would've ruined my family's reputation.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.660
- Right.
- Right?

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.630
What a despicable family.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.060
(Chu Mansion)
Shameless!

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.900
Isn't it?

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.980
Chu Yu,

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.430
this is your business.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.900
Why do we have to suffer humiliation

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.560
because of you?

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.020
Isn't she Mrs. Wei?

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.060
Oh, no. We don't know if she's Mrs. Wei

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.740
or the Marchioness of Zhenguo.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.260
You're right.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.580
Isn't this

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.780
going too far?

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.580
- Mother.
- Shameless!

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.700
Disgracing the family!

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.660
Shameless!

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.820
Disgracing the family!

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.660
It's all your fault!

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.780
If it were me, I would've hanged myself.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.260
Let go of him!

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.100
Let go!

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.980
Let go of him!

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.580
Put him down!

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.820
He's killing him!

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.700
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.540
Let go!

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.980
Wei Yun,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.820
let him go!

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.380
Let him go!

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.500
He will die if you keep this up!

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.820
Wei Yun.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.660
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.820
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.980
Are you alright?

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.280
The Marquis of Zhenguo

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.780
is saving a beauty.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.580
What a good deed.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.700
Shameless!

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.780
How shameless!

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.900
Isn't it?

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.940
Yu!

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.140
Yu!

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.980
How dare you splash me!

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.140
If you ever do it again,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.900
I will tear down your mansion gates!

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.340
Get lost!

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.700
(Disgracing the family)

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.300
- He serves it.
- He's right.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.340
Exactly.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.200
With your poor personal conduct,

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.700
you two don't deserve your positions.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.640
Just you wait.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.580
There's still justice.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.660
It will not spare you.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.080
That plaque was earned

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.260
by your father

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.700
with his military merits.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.400
You've disgraced yourselves.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.860
What do you need this plaque for?

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.020
Take it down!

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.340
- Exactly.
- Take it down!

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.820
- Take it down!
- Take it down!

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.600
- Take it down!
- Take it down!

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.580
Take it down!

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.420
Don't you dare!

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.420
Take it down!

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.420
You don't deserve it.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.100
It's a disgrace to your father's name.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.580
Take it down! Take it down!

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.420
Hurry!

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.860
Take it down for me!

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.580
A bunch of shameless people!

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.580
Take it down!

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.340
Come on!

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.340
Take it down!

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.740
Take it down!

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.500
(Chu Mansion)

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.820
- Take it down!
- Take it down!

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.980
Take it down!

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.140
(Chu)

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.300
Chu Linyang!

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.460
What are you doing?

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.860
What's so important about a plaque?

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.820
Today, I will take it down

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.500
and place it here.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.260
Everyone can step on it.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.980
Everyone can curse at it.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.980
The reputation of my family

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.300
never relies on a single plaque.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.460
My family

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.740
and I are here.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.660
As long as my family

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.220
stands in this world for one more day,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.660
the family name will not fall.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.140
The reputation of my family

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.740
lies in the court

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.340
and with the people.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.420
Everyone can see

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.820
what we've done.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.540
Your smear won't change anything.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.060
If anyone still has doubts,

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.300
come to me!

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.940
Let's go.

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.140
- Wait here.
- You wait.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.700
Let's go.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.180
Let's go now.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.780
Linyang.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.060
Did you get hurt because of this?

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.460
It's nothing.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.260
What you've suffered

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.420
is merely physical pain,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.180
but what Yu has endured

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.620
is public opinion.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.300
For a woman,

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.420
it is no different from a hanging.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.500
But no one can see her wound.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.660
I can see it.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.380
I asked you about this.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.980
If I want to carve out a path for Yu,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.180
will you believe me?

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.820
That's not important.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.020
I have always prioritized Yu.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.820
But Yu's actions

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.060
are only driven by her heart.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.700
Back then,

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.420
at the risk of being criticized
by everyone,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.660
she wore her red dress

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.000
and married your brother.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.940
If it weren't

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.500
for today's incident,

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.260
I think

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.260
she would still choose you

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.100
without hesitation.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.740
Yes.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.500
She is indeed a woman

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.940
who fears nothing.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.500
But even the most fearless person

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.220
has a soft spot in their heart.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.340
Her soft spot

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.620
is Father.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.620
In her heart,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.220
her feelings for Father

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.980
are more important

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.460
than her feelings for you.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.700
Moreover,

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.180
the impact of this incident

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.310
on your family

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.040
is far less than that on us.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.640
You are the Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.880
a descendant of a century-old family.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:51.940
In this matter,

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.580
you can extricate yourself.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.820
But Yu can't.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.380
I know.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.820
I've seen what happened today.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.460
In this world,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.180
it is not easy for a woman to live,

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.980
let alone be deliberately framed

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.740
and bear unfounded

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:12.580
sins of filth.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.540
Even with a clear conscience,

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.860
one has to be stripped

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.780
by baseless rumors.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.300
Rumors and slander

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.300
often ruin women.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.900
The world

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.940
doesn't care about the truth.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.580
They just want to join

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.420
the commotion.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.460
Do you know

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.380
gossip can also be fatal?

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.480
But I have the ability

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.580
to stand in front of her

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.360
and protect her for a lifetime.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.480
How can you protect her?

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.340
By killing all the gossips?

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.640
We will talk about the matters

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.600
between you two later.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.380
Yu has already taken

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.500
the divorce paper.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.900
She'll stay with us.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.140
Young Marquis,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:17.940
go back now.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.300
How could he do this?

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.260
Why?

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.020
Please stop crying.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.020
Linyang,

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:43.940
you are my eldest son.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.380
You'll inherit the family property

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.740
and bring glory to our ancestors.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.220
But you ruined your reputation

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.300
for your sister.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.420
You even took down our plaque.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.100
Chu Linyang,

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.940
you've spoiled your sister so much.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.460
What do you

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.060
take your parents for?

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.420
Mother.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.420
Mother,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.700
I did all that

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.260
for our family.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.900
Linyang,

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.980
stop talking nonsense.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.620
Have you also been driven mad

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.260
by Yu?

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:28.460
Jin,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.340
you've always asked me

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.460
why I always protect Yu

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.060
so unreasonably.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.460
What I did

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.560
is also for our family.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.700
You always accuse Yu

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.700
of being outrageous.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.100
Do you know

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.900
she's taking great risks

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.060
for our family?

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.460
What do you mean?

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.340
You think Yu

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.700
ruined her reputation

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.860
by marrying Wei Jun,

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.820
but it was never

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.260
for herself.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.300
She was to find out

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.060
the truth behind Father's death.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.860
So, Yu did all this

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.940
for our family?

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.180
Why didn't you tell me
and Mother earlier?

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.980
Father's death

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.140
is involved in many things.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.940
If outsiders knew

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.180
that we were investigating this,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.780
we'd be dismissed

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.660
and imprisoned at best

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.100
and killed

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.660
at worst.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.460
Mother,

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.140
if you didn't know

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.780
any of this,

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.940
Jin and you

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.620
would live an easier life.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.020
Let Yu and me

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.580
take the burden of this.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.700
Mother,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.100
Yu is indeed rebellious

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.400
and doesn't listen to advice.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.260
As the widow of Wei Jun,

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.900
she did fall in love with Wei Yun

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.420
and implicated our family.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.860
But without these burdens,

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.420
the affection

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.500
between her and Wei Yun

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.060
could also be considered normal.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.020
Linyang,

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.100
today,

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.980
tell me everything

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.780
that happened.
