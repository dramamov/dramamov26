[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.920
[Episode 28]

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.840
[Tingyun Pavilion]

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.120
I also brought gifts for Miss Shei,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.400
Stone, Mr. Tang,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.509
and Gu Xitan.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:35.759
Foxy Tang went back to his room to rest

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.509
after seeing Minister Tang off.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.479
Your Highness, why don't you

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.710
let me keep these for you?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.000
Don't call me Your Highness.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.310
Although I'm a princess now,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.039
I grew up in the Sword Alliance.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.150
Only when

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.920
I'm with you guys

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.180
do I feel truly at ease.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.490
This is my home.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.350
Me too.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.009
Not until Mr. Tang took me in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.759
and I met everyone

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.080
did I know what a home feels like.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.130
Give it back!

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.280
Why are you chasing me?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.790
Xianling Herb is for making soup,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.870
not for feeding curse bugs.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.600
Let me feed it to the bugs first!

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.930
Give it back to me!

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.560
Don't chase me!

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.230
If you want it,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.490
go pick some yourself!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.400
Come back!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.470
Stop chasing me!

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.610
Alright,
let's not talk about this anymore.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.870
With us here and Foxy Tang,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.079
as long as we're together,

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.240
this will always be

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.840
our home.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.820
Someone as strong-willed as her

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.110
has finally stepped into a bright future.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.840
How could I not be happy for her?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.350
But...

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.880
she's drifting away from me.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.079
It hurts, Senior.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.520
-You always…
-It's a good thing that it hurts.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.620
A promising young man like you
shouldn't belittle yourself,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.020
or you'll remain this way
your entire life.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.560
I'm not.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.150
I'm just...

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.079
Speak properly.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.060
Don't be so bashful.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.420
The way you look now

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.020
is what really makes you unworthy of her.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.570
Look at them.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.280
Aside from Tang Lici,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.240
who among them has a noble background?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.370
Do they act like you?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.520
Yes.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.230
She's a princess now.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.280
But she...

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.390
is also Ms. Zhong from the Sword Alliance.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.800
Your swordsmanship is so poor.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.360
You still have the nerve
to think about this?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.150
Besides,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.990
if she's really keeping her distance
from you because of that,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.940
why bother

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.230
pursuing her?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.110
You're right.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.020
Thank you, Senior.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.800
Good.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.840
Go now.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:39.790
Senior.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.280
You seem to understand everything
so clearly.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.940
How come...

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.240
you still don't have a wife?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.050
Gu Xitan, you little brat! I...

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:48.890
Zhong!

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.480
I have to say,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.350
the dinner Shei made tonight was amazing.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.030
I was about to burst.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.710
You're still alive, aren't you?

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.590
Why is it that after spending so much time

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.470
with Foxy Tang,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.530
you've only picked up his bad habits?

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.750
The Little Fox isn't here?

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.680
He went to see off the Minister Tang

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.480
and hasn't come back yet.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.040
He's probably
slacking off somewhere again.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040
Come on, Senior.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.600
I don't mean to blame you,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600
but you can't just show up

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.800
out of nowhere

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.720
just because I used to admire you.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.270
That's so...

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.310
Stop it.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.510
I, your senior,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.970
am in a foul mood right now.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.720
I finally made it to Mount Baojing,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.180
and none of you were there—

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.420
not even the old woman.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.540
Who are you calling an old woman?

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.190
Whoever responds first, that's who.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.680
You...

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.220
You don't have to be like this.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.970
Where is Xue Fu?

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.510
Xue Fu is so small.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.630
I'd like to see

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.830
what kind of precious treasure this is.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.800
A chicken?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.000
My little darling Xue Fu.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.590
Wait, wait.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.150
Wait.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.390
Xue Fu is a chicken?

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.030
-Chicken?
-Chicken?

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.430
-She's Xue Fu!
-She's Xue Fu!

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.870
Isn't Xue Fu a chicken?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.720
-Xue Fu is not a chicken.
-Xue Fu is not a chicken.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.580
-Xue Fu is Xue Fu.
-Xue Fu is Xue Fu.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.430
Shen,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.270
this...

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.090
Xue Fu is not a chicken.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.430
Xue Fu is Xue Fu.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.690
Look.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.670
How interesting.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.040
You two really are interesting.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.510
See? I told you.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.730
You're the only blind one here

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.570
who can't see how beautiful Xue Fu is.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.100
From the very first glance,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.040
I felt she was unnaturally pretty.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.770
Look at her fur, those little paws—

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.310
one of a kind

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.920
in this world, got it?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.550
Shui Duopo, I'm telling you,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.430
Xue Fu is just

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.560
temporarily staying with you.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.690
I'll be checking on her anytime I want.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.890
Your claws are dirty. Don't touch it.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.630
Just one touch.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.560
Don't touch her!

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.140
So cute.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.750
Am I the only one who doesn't see it?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.390
So cute.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.550
Just one last step,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.920
and I can turn back time

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.560
and rewrite fate.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.290
You'll help me, won't you,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.800
Brother?

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.050
You were the crown prince
of the former dynasty?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.840
The chaos caused by Yique Yinyang

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.240
began because my father trusted traitors.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.980
Though I was the crown prince,

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.490
I failed to stop my father.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.750
I could only watch helplessly

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.410
as people suffered terribly.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.780
Your Highness,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.510
the rebels have taken several cities.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.780
His Majesty is still unconscious.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.840
At a time like this,

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.120
have you really made up your mind

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.380
to go to Tianjing Pavilion to cultivate?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.370
I can't save

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.280
hundreds of thousands of lives.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.610
Therefore,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.159
I might as well go to Tianjing Pavilion
to cultivate.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:38.870
I am,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.270
among all those still living,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.490
the one who deserves death the most.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.550
If I'm still alive,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.390
then others certainly shouldn't die.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.920
If I cannot forgive others,

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.060
I certainly cannot forgive myself.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.390
Then I must
make an agreement with you, Sir.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.250
We'll keep each other's secrets.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.200
Don't tell anyone

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.150
about my secret,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.720
and I won't tell anyone

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.120
who you really are.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.330
A mistake is a mistake.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.870
Pain doesn't disappear

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.590
just because you hide the truth.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.560
I'm telling you,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.980
this myna is really smart.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.830
It just called me a genius.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.180
Are you sure it wasn't insulting you?

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.950
How could that be an insult?

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.510
What's going on?

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.800
It definitely was insulting you.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.130
What are you looking at?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.480
Mr. Chi, Senior.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.970
What's so special about this bird?

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.809
This myna's no ordinary bird.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.250
It can not only talk,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.380
but also

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.240
tell a person's

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240
most accurate trait

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.570
the moment it sees them.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.030
The most accurate trait?

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:43.870
Yes.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.680
Princess, Princess.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.080
See?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.080
Right?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.960
Smart, huh?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.820
This bird is really interesting.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.160
What about me?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.280
What about me?

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.270
Silly dog.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.080
Silly dog.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.440
You...

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.200
-Mr. Chi...
-I'll...

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.670
Don't be rash.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.720
I'll teach you a lesson!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.970
Chi Yun! Chi Yun!

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.170
When something's out of the ordinary,
there's usually something fishy behind it.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.830
Master Puzhu, your leg injury

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.960
has healed already.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.760
It's all thanks to you,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.970
Mr. Tang.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.000
It's all thanks to Shui Duopo's

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.330
superb medical skills.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.880
It had nothing to do with me.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.590
I can tell

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.800
you've got something on your mind too.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.080
Crown prince! Crown prince!

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.570
Lately, there have been

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.870
so many of these gossiping birds

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.130
in the Sword Alliance.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.690
Master Puzhu, you don't get out much,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.620
so it's no wonder

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.650
you don't know.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.270
Mr. Tang,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.310
did you come to see me early this morning

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.510
just to watch mynas leaving their nest?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.840
Mynas

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.860
are birds with regular patterns.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.360
They leave their nests at dawn

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.480
and return at dusk.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.750
Have you received any letters
from your family

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.270
during these years

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.630
at Tianjing Pavilion?

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.180
Cultivators

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.370
sever their ties to family,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.480
like flowers parted from their branches,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.740
drifting with the wind

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.030
and never asking where they came from.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.830
But what if...

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.240
your family

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.510
wants to see you?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.050
Once separated,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.670
meeting again is but a delusion.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.150
Mr. Tang,
why do you ask these questions today?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.000
I just saw birds leaving their nests

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.800
and felt somewhat melancholic.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.910
My ties to the past were severed

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.170
the moment I entered Tianjing Pavilion.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.690
But yours

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.670
are still trapped

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.870
in that Zhoudi Tower.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.470
Sir, are you trying to lecture me again?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.600
I heard about the Battle of Peony Pavilion

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.550
from Master Shao

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.970
and Master Cheng.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.970
I did hold prejudice against you

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.390
in the past.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.670
Mr. Tang, your obsession

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.770
may end up hurting you.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.240
I hope you

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.860
can let go of your past.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.240
So you're

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.840
concerned about me?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.610
But perhaps...

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.840
I need this obsession

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.750
so I won't be

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.080
a wandering ghost.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.480
My injury is healed.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.550
I'm heading down the mountain today

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.910
to lead the Sword Alliance disciples

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.030
in investigating leads

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.480
on Fengliu Shop's new base

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.940
and to demolish it in time.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.120
Then I wish you

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.340
never have to look back

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.810
on your sacred path.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.700
Mr. Tang.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.150
It's nothing.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.220
You may go down the mountain, Sir.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.880
I, Xijin,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.600
formally invite you to Shisan Tower
for a discussion

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.400
on the plan to restore the country.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.440
You have 3 days.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.520
If you don't arrive by then,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.760
I will announce

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.550
your noble status to the world.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.090
And Shisan Tower

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.250
will share honor and disgrace with you.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.490
Xijin.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.800
Not only are you going to reveal

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.460
Master Puzhu's identity
in the former dynasty,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.870
but you also want to involve him

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.390
with Shisan Tower.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.630
Master Fang,

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.290
you really never learn to behave.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.220
Restore the country?

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.120
You're trying to

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.050
drag Master Puzhu into rebellion.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.000
I, Tang Lici,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.520
am here specifically

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.320
to visit Fang Pingzhai, the head

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.130
of the Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.840
Mr. Tang,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.720
if I remember correctly,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:21.350
the letter

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.680
was meant for Master Puzhu, right?

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.680
Master Puzhu...

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.770
doesn't want to see you.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.830
That's really unfair.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.870
You treat me like nothing,

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.320
yet you care so much

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.560
for my brother,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.330
the crown prince of the former dynasty,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.570
Chai Zongxun,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.120
now the high and mighty Master Puzhu

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.700
of Tianjing Pavilion,

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.840
even venturing into Shisan Tower alone
for him.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.700
I have to admit,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.240
I'm a little jealous.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.960
The first time I ventured into the tower,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.150
I already told you

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.400
that being overly obsessed

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.910
isn't a good thing.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.840
So is being like Master Puzhu,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.200
detached from everything,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.330
really a good thing?

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.320
Or do you really think he has

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
transcended worldly attachments

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.720
and let go of everything?

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:14.910
Wrong.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.790
He's just too ashamed

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.910
to face his disgraceful past.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.910
He's avoiding it.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.240
If Chai Zongxun

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.510
truly has a clear conscience,

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.080
why doesn't he dare to face me?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.150
Back then, he let the rebel army
into the city,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.120
leaving the country to me,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.120
an inexperienced boy,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.720
and then simply walked away.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.120
Fortunately, that night

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.840
I took the advice of my old ministers

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.870
and escaped through the secret passage
with the royal treasury.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.390
That's how I was able to found
the Fallen Shisan Tower

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.840
and raise my loyal assassins.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.390
Now,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.750
I've finally found a way

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.720
to stand under the sun again,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.270
openly and rightfully.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.430
That throne has always belonged...

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.360
Kneel!

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.290
Remnant of the former dynasty!

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.290
Don't you realize

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.750
who you're talking to?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.270
Tell me.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.800
Who's behind all this?

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.360
You knew from the start

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.720
that I could use the Rebirth Scroll.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.580
Liu Yan would never tell you this.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.760
Whoever told you

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.120
must be someone else.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.510
Who is this person?

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.270
Is it Ghostly Peony?

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.410
How about this?

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.650
Teach me the Rebirth Scroll,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.450
and I'll tell you where he is.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.940
Mr. Tang, you truly are clever.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.640
This is called Inverted Dream.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.360
It is a magical artifact
created by Qiaoyi Qiankun,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.120
capable of traveling to the past

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.080
and reversing time.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.660
It contains the power from Tianren Realm.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.570
It needs the Rebirth Scroll
to activate it.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.300
Originally,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.350
I asked Chai Zongxun
to come to Shisan Tower

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.350
because I wanted him to persuade you

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.720
to activate this magical artifact for me.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.110
I didn't expect you to come uninvited.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.700
What a pleasant surprise.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.120
Tang Lici,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.440
now I command you

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.960
to use the power of the Rebirth Scroll

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200
to activate the Inverted Dream

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.800
and help me rewrite history.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:08.970
Otherwise,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.240
my men will immediately

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240
announce to the world

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.720
that Master Puzhu is the crown prince

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.980
of the former dynasty.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.460
Think about it.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.380
If the current emperor

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.440
learns of this,

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.359
will he turn a blind eye

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.510
and keep his alliance

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.000
with the Sword Alliance

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.030
to fight against the Fengliu Shop,

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.400
or will he see

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.350
Chai Zongxun and me,

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.120
remnants of the former dynasty,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.510
as the greater threat?

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.420
Then you'll have to die.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.310
Killing me won't do you any good.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:37.770
Wait.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.200
Xijin,

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.300
I'll go in with you.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.730
Not entering Tianjing Pavilion

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.390
and instead fighting
alongside you and Father—

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.340
isn't that what you wanted?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.560
That's my brother!

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.610
Master Puzhu.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.330
This is my own karmic debt

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.260
and the Chai family's sin.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.120
If the Inverted Dream is real,

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.230
I'll have a chance to rewrite history

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.410
and take responsibility on the day

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.410
of the rebellion,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.130
sparing the people

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.460
from the flames of war.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.320
Let's see whether this choice

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.200
can change

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.360
the outcome.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.450
Can it really

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.300
change the outcome?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.310
I see.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.200
Master Puzhu,

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.790
your own karma

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.560
should be resolved by yourself.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.680
I will

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.270
activate this magical artifact for you

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.870
and send you back to the past.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.480
I've already set the time—

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.720
the year of the Battle of Tiandu Peak.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.630
The Inverted Dream is real.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.470
Your Highness!

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.310
Your Highness,

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.770
you can't enter Tianjing Pavilion

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.730
at such a time!

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.300
The rebel army has taken several cities,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.540
His Majesty is still unconscious,

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.830
and the Imperial Preceptor
is at Tiandu Peak,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.450
far away and unable to return in time.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.090
Yet you want to enter
Tianjing Pavilion now?

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:42.980
The enemy is at our gates.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.370
Your Highness, please reconsider!

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.050
Your Highness, I beg you

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.210
to guard the capital

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.710
and quell the rebellion!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.680
Your Highness!

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.210
Brother,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.720
over the years I've been sending

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.750
Shisan Tower's sworn assassins

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.830
across the land to gather intelligence

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.030
and uncover the cause

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.200
of this war.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.310
I know exactly where the main forces

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.510
of the rebel army are

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.030
and where they hide their supplies.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.240
We have a huge advantage,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.700
enough to win this battle.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.200
If you stay to help me

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.090
defend the capital

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.260
and pin the enemy down,

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.830
I can strike under cover of night,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.400
slip past their front,
penetrate into their rear

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.640
to burn their provisions,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.300
and deal them a decisive blow.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.240
Will this plan end the war

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.980
and reduce casualties?

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.220
All these years,

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.200
I've been running simulations
of this battle every day.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.460
No one knows this battle better than I do,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.920
and no one knows better

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.480
how to win it.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.960
I promise

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.640
I won't seek glory in battle;

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.040
I will limit the fighting

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.470
so losses are minimized.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.090
Carry out my orders:

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.200
dispatch 5000 elite troops immediately

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.560
for the Sixth Prince to command.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.640
Bring the civilians outside the city
into the walls for shelter.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.170
Open the treasury for military expenses
and soldier compensation.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.100
Spread the word

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.510
that His Majesty
has regained consciousness

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.350
and intends to execute
the traitor Yique Yinyang

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.650
to uphold imperial order.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:24.910
If the rebels abandon their cause

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.180
and surrender to the royal forces,

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.260
they will be pardoned.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.000
If they persist in their rebellion,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.510
they will face punishment.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.200
Meanwhile, urgently summon
the loyal forces everywhere

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.130
to aid the throne

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.570
and save the nation.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.720
Yes, Your Highness!

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.960
Master Puzhu is truly

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.160
a man of great talent.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.590
However,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.440
when you returned to the past,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.030
why did you all avoid

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.640
mentioning that topic?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.370
Master Shao,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.480
during the turmoil of the former dynasty,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.610
why didn't Yique Yinyang come to help?

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.810
Wasn't he the Imperial Preceptor?

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.750
I've been puzzled

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.210
about this for a long time.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.270
According to captured palace eunuchs,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.160
Yique Yinyang

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.220
once sighted a dragon at Tiandu Peak,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.200
so when the former dynasty's emperor

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.130
fell into a coma,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.170
he chose that place to pray for him.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.350
Tiandu Peak is far from the capital.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.640
When the rebel army heard the news,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.440
they believed the time to strike had come,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.510
so they called heroes
from the martial arts world

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.070
to jointly attack Yique Yinyang

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.440
to pin him down.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.680
Taking advantage of that, the rebel army

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.940
breached the capital.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.880
Strangely, however,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.550
after the battle,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.640
no signs of any ritual

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.070
were found at the site.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.720
According to Yique Yinyang's attendant,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.880
he simply stood on the cliff

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.200
every day, gazing into the distance

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.350
and staring at the sky

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.650
day and night without rest.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.420
And he wouldn't let anyone approach him,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.080
which was quite frightening.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.200
Some say

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.550
Yique Yinyang wasn't looking at the sky

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.040
but waiting for someone.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:58.960
Or rather,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.570
waiting for the dragon he had seen before.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.840
There are many theories anyway.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.240
Waiting for someone?

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.170
Your Highness!

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:25.990
The Sixth Prince's surprise attack
succeeded;

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.550
he took the rebels' supply port,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.750
and the rebels
have withdrawn from the capital.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.510
We won!

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.970
Where is the Sixth Prince now?

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:32.740
The Sixth Prince

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.030
seized the rebels' warships

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.270
and is preparing to lead the army north

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.130
to Tiandu Peak!

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.650
Saddle the horses!

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.120
You're going to save Yique Yinyang?

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.980
Are you insane?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.460
Listen to me carefully!

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.960
I've run through this scenario many times.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.160
With conventional tactics,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.320
we won't win.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.830
The rebels
have only temporarily withdrawn.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.850
Only by seizing this opportunity
to take the port

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.270
and send a fleet straight to Tiandu Peak

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.810
to bring back the Imperial Preceptor

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.480
can we turn the situation around.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.830
Otherwise, with our forces as they are,

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.720
we'll keep losing
no matter how many times we try.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.160
Let me tell you what will happen next

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.460
according to my calculations.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.130
Rebirth Scroll,

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.610
close.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.590
After the rebel army is destroyed,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.730
the frontier army will revolt.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.710
We'll suppress the frontier army,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.580
then the imperial guards will rebel.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.410
Why is it not working?

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.960
The war will last for years,

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.680
and the land will remain soaked
with the people's blood.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.080
No matter how hard we try,

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.960
the result
will always be the same—a fallen nation

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.280
and countless deaths.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.950
It takes 4 hours

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.070
to extinguish the Inverted Dream,

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.510
which corresponds to 4 months

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.400
in our world.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.350
After 4 months,
the Imperial Preceptor will return,

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.150
and our nation will be restored.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.250
I had planned to bring Tang Lici here

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.400
so he could witness the glory
of my grand endeavor.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.380
But by now, he is likely

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.410
still unconscious beneath Mount Li.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.740
What a pity!

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.780
So that's how it is.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:02.900
Brother,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.440
now,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.750
only the Imperial Preceptor has the power

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.880
to awe the world

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.480
and bring peace to the realm.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.550
As long as he lives, the nation endures.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.720
I'll bring your empire back

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.240
for you!

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.490
Guards!

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.930
From this day forward,

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.070
the Crown Prince is forbidden to leave

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.930
the naval camp.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.120
Yique Yinyang wasn't looking at the sky

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.560
but waiting for someone.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.680
Or rather,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.440
waiting for the dragon he had seen before.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.960
It takes 4 hours

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.740
to extinguish the Inverted Dream,

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.400
which corresponds to 4 months

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.240
in our world.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.110
Time?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.400
The dragon?

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.310
No,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.300
Fang Pingzhai miscalculated.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.530
What he refers to as this moment

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.860
is actually half a month

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.630
within the Inverted Dream.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.680
At that time,

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.340
I had not yet arrived in Shenzhou.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.010
So

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.360
what Yique Yinyang saw back then

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.830
was me, fighting the dragon,

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.500
preparing to escape from Tianren Realm.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.510
If I enter the Inverted Dream as well,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.110
with my full mastery

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.720
of the Rebirth Scroll at that time,

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.180
I will be able to kill Yique Yinyang
for sure.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.880
[Tiandu Peak]

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.250
Why...

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:15.750
am I...

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.480
inside Yique Yinyang's body?

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.630
Yique Yinyang,

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.000
you're not leaving here today!

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.030
Fang Zhou.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.750
Fang Zhou?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.960
Who's in my mind?

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.920
"Power shakes the world," Jiangnan Feng,

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.180
"Ant trying to shake a tree," Wei Beiyin,

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.420
Heavenly Flame Sword Phoenix, Yu Xuanqing,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.370
Kuanglan Wuxing, Zhu Yan,

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.490
"Deer in the wind," Qin Kunwu,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.010
The Combination of Zen and Martial Arts,
Master Tainxuan,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.160
and you...

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.350
Seven‑String True Tune,

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.720
Fang Zhou.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.080
You think you can take me down

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.080
with the entire martial arts world?

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.850
That's far too heavy a burden

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.590
for you to bear.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.130
Today's battle

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.070
is either the slaying of a demon

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.600
or a martyrdom
for the path of righteousness.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.680
Just self-indulgent heroism.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.980
The Sixth Heaven Demon,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.680
Silence.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.280
Seven‑String True Tune!

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:24.870
Break!

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:01.240
Mortals,

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.820
how dare you offend a deity?

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.240
With one strike,

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.300
I could kill you all.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.670
Fang Zhou!

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.400
Stop!

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.140
Stop it!

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.100
Everyone,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.070
allow me

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.110
to make the first move!

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.830
Light Technique!

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.230
Heavenly Sacred Light!

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.970
Tai'e Sword's Offering!

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.340
The Seven‑String True Tune.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.440
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.010
Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.170
I'm not dead yet.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.370
No.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.000
It's Yique Yinyang who's not dead.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.720
But with such severe injuries,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.580
he cannot possibly heal himself.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.270
Ghostly Peony?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.750
As long as you are alive,

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.480
I haven't lost.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.070
Master Puzhu.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.920
Why?

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.130
Why?

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.760
Are you alright?

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.950
Where exactly did I go wrong?

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.230
Where?

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.040
Master Fang,

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.610
it's time to wake up.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.450
You cannot change
what has already happened.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.150
As its name,

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.370
Inverted Dream, suggests,

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:13.190
it was nothing

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.449
but a dream of the past.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.810
To cling too tightly to a dream

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960
is mere delusion.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.070
Reverse time?

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840
Ghostly Peony!

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:40.969
You lied to me!

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.810
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.290
You've spent a great deal of energy

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:08.720
to activate the Inverted Dream.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.470
I

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.910
will remember

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:11.660
this favor.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.230
I just

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.560
wanted to find an answer

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.000
for myself.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.400
Tang Lici,

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.760
I didn't expect
you could enter the dream as well.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.100
Who were you inside it?

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:44.800
Master Fang,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.110
to me,

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.280
this wasn't a dream.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.920
It was a trap.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.440
A trap

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.210
whose beginning I don't know,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.460
whose boundaries I can't see.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.890
All I know is that

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.020
I am its prey.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.400
I

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.550
hate that feeling.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.890
Foxy Tang!

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.550
Where did you go behind my back

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.630
this time?

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.190
Chi Yun.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.780
What are you...

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.660
What are you doing standing here?

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.550
He has something on his mind.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.610
Don't disturb him.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.030
Ghostly Peony!

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.150
You lied to me!

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.010
Ghostly Peony?

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.670
The one I saw under the sea

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.730
was Ghostly Peony.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.480
He's Yique Yinyang's

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.440
backup plan.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.140
As long as you're alive,

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.070
I haven't lost.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.710
Could it be

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.970
that Yique Yinyang is still alive?

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.870
Or is he extending his life

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.600
somehow,

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.850
plotting his resurrection?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.670
And I...

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.530
Mount Baojing?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.110
No.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.780
Perhaps long before this,

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.030
he had been

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.280
watching me

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.340
like an unseen eye.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.740
He has been guiding me all along,

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.920
making me believe

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.700
that he and I are alike.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:50.840
Why?

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.820
Now,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.320
he has become
the most perfect Tianren body

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.360
ever created in Tianren Realm.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.760
So that's it.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.230
He wants my Tianren body.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.810
I haven't seen you for days.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.150
Where have you been?

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.160
I went to the Fallen Shisan Tower

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.080
to take care of a small problem.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.360
Master Shao.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.030
Yique Yinyang

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.710
is not dead.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.510
With the 7 masters
on Tiandu Peak attacking him

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.550
and the injuries

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.840
he suffered,

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.920
how could he possibly still be alive?

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.450
Master Shao, don't forget,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.280
Yique Yinyang and I

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.180
share the same origin.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.280
He possesses

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.980
the same physique as I do.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.030
Oh no.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:04.920
However,

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.870
though he's not dead,

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.710
he's not exactly alive either.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:09.640
What do you mean?

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:10.870
Resurrection

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.670
requires a body.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.840
Without one,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.230
he cannot truly be resurrected.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.190
What do you mean?

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.000
What I mean is—

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.920
I have my own way.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.320
You might as well tell me now.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.670
Master Shao,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.480
someone will tell you

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.760
everything

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.660
you want to know in the future.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.190
Mr. Tang,

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.500
I know you always have your own ideas.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.360
I won't

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.070
ask further.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.550
But I hope

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.840
that at least one day,

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.530
you can let go
of the restraints in your heart

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.590
and live once as the true Tang Lici.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.440
Thank you, Master Shao.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.280
Mr. Tang,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.150
who is this statue of?

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.960
You've always been clever.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.890
Can't you guess?

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.150
Fang Zhou.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.310
You're going to die here today.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.030
If one person's death

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.190
can save everyone,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.750
then why not?

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.280
Fang Zhou,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.710
if one person's death

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.060
can save everyone else,

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.880
does that person have to die?

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.630
Lici,

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.980
living is a right everyone deserves.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.390
No matter who you are,

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.830
you shouldn't give up.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.880
Looking back,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.790
at that time, Fang Zhou

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.120
must have already known

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.760
that I am the key

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.690
to Yique Yinyang's resurrection.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.610
I didn't understand back then.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.400
Now,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.740
I no longer have the chance to ask.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:58.850
Mr. Tang,

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.350
why are you carving this puppet?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.060
Because...

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.150
I finally understand

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.880
what he was thinking back then.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.250
Rice cakes?

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.060
Chi kept saying he wanted some.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.920
He said it wouldn't be New Year
without them.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.030
So I made some.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.410
He's quite good at making demands.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:36.670
By the way,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.190
I also prepared some

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.050
for Shui Duopo.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.010
I'll take them to her
while they're still hot.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360
Mr. Tang,

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.870
I know you've always had your own ideas.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:51.590
I

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.570
won't ask further.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.480
But I hope

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.440
that at least one day,

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.130
you can let go
of the restraints in your heart

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.590
and live once as the true Tang Lici.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.930
Then, before I do that,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.350
I'll live one day as the real Tang Lici

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.190
and live for myself.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.070
Senior.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.730
What are you doing here?

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.300
I just made some rice cakes

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.760
and brought them for you.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.010
Come inside.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.550
Senior,

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.410
try some.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:50.110
Your...

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.900
Your cooking
is better than the imperial chefs'.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.090
If you'd like more,

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.470
I'll bring some again next time.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:43:59.800
Good.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.330
Please bring more then.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.360
I'll reward you.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:03.910
No need.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:05.690
I'm just glad you like it.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.320
I'm not like Xue Xianzi,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.320
that freeloader.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.090
Give me your hand.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.190
I'll take your pulse.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.230
I'm not sick.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.740
I'm not saying you are.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.390
I just want to write you a prescription

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.150
to replenish your energy
and balance your body.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:21.960
Besides,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.070
I'm quite interested in the constitution

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:25.190
of medicine men.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:26.360
Think of it

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.230
as me doing a bit of research.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.590
Here.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.250
It's just taking your pulse—

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.580
why are you being so shy?

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:39.510
Your constitution

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.800
really is unusual.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.070
What's this?

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:54.920
Senior,

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.660
why don't we...

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.070
just forget it?

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.160
I'm sorry.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.810
I didn't mean it that way.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.590
I'm just a bit curious—

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.710
how have you managed to survive until now?
