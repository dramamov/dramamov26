To Chang'an]

[Great Buddha Hall]

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.729
I wonder if
the Lu family of Fanyang's promise

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.640
can save Buddhist Guangxiao?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.330
I actually think

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.710
Buddhist Guangxiao

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.970
would trust our mentor, Master Di, more.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.780
Disciple of Master Di, Su Wuming.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.750
Disciple of Master Di,
Lu Lingfeng from Fanyang.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.009
The two of us pledge in our mentor's name.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.240
And I'm willing to attach

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.680
the reputation of
the Lu family of Fanyang to this.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.590
Concerning the case
involving Chengfo Temple,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.560
we'll make every effort to
investigate and resolve it swiftly

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.150
We'll restore your innocence

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.280
as well as the temple's reputation.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.480
Buddhist Guangxiao,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.240
please have faith in us.

Are we really going to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.240
close the case hastily
as Du Ming suggested?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.040
Of course not.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.210
Then why did you...

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.780
It was just a delaying tactic.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.800
But now Wu Yang

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.520
is still nowhere to be found,
dead or alive.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.400
We don't have any leads.

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.040
I wouldn't put it that way.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.970
I think we have plenty of leads.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.960
Well, tell me then.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.840
First,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.430
if the Ever-changing Master wasn't lying,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.590
then how did Wu Yang's clothes

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.120
end up

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.750
on the victim?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.310
Perhaps

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.030
that Ever-changing Master's words

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.360
can't be trusted at all.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.310
He could have rescued Wu Yang

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.520
from Qu River again

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.110
and then killed her.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.000
What you said actually makes sense.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.400
It's all my fault.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.680
In that desperate moment,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.590
I kicked too hard.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.120
Now that the Ever-changing Master is dead,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.240
it's impossible to tell
whether his words were true or false.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.500
Thinking about it now,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.710
we can only

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.170
examine that female corpse again

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.280
to identify her.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.240
Is this appropriate?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.910
Don't you call yourself a warrior?

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.710
How come you're acting so timid?

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.720
I'm not being timid.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.750
I mean as for examining the corpse,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.750
shouldn't we tell

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.010
Su Wuming and Lu Lingfeng about it first?

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.280
There's no time to worry about that now.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.880
I must see it with my own eyes.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.430
The body is not Wu Yang.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.360
Definitely not.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.970
What did you say?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.930
You two went to examine the corpse?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.750
I know

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.560
we shouldn't have gone to the morgue
without permission.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.070
It's just

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.510
I suddenly

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.840
remembered something.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.970
That day...

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.990
Can I be friends with you two?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.020
I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.290
have no friends.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.600
Of course.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.430
That day, I saw on her hand

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.480
a very exquisite plum blossom brand.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.560
I was thinking at the time

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.750
that when we went to visit
Qu River together,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.750
I would ask her how she got that brand.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.600
But there was no brand on that corpse.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.800
Xijun, you've really been a great help.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.660
No, it's not Wu Yang.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.180
This is not Wu Yang.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.330
My daughter Wu Yang might still be alive.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.720
There's no plum blossom brand on her hand.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.720
She's not Wu Yang.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.350
She's not.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.320
Then that day, why did you...

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.070
I...

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.360
Since her clothes and build

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.159
both matched,

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.960
I just...

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.510
So how did she get
that plum blossom brand?

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.040
When Wu Yang was 6 years old,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.810
one day,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.590
she was almost abducted.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.360
I desperately chased after them

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.040
and managed to snatch her back.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.870
I immediately asked that person,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.730
"Why did you abduct my daughter?"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.680
He said...

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.060
He said that Wu Yang

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.000
looked exactly like Empress Wu Zetian.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.810
At that moment,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.960
I was absolutely terrified.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.800
I was worried something bad
might happen to Wu Yang again,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.600
so I went to consult a Taoist priest.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.680
The priest instructed me

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.870
to have a plum blossom brand

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.070
burned into this spot

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.130
of Wu Yang's hand.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.950
This way, Wu Yang would forever

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.490
be bound to my side.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.360
Bound?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.420
She's a living person.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.070
How could she be bound to you?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.600
Besides,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.310
how could you have missed

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.640
such an important lead?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.680

As soon as I saw the body, I...

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.490
It was my fault.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.270

has always been remarkably perceptive.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.440
He figured out that the person
I've been thinking about day and night

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.200
would be returning to
Hanzhou Prefecture with you,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.910
so he invited me here to see you off.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.930
Am I to be disappointed?

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.320
It's you.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.390
I'm sorry, ladies.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.320
To break free from your mother's control,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.170
these two ladies you just happened to meet

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.500
have also become your pawns?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I had no choice.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.080
I heard

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.080
the Fairy Beauty Powder

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.080
can remove spots and blemishes,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.750
and also enhance the skin's radiance.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.870
Is it really that miraculous?

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.570
It is.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.890
Please wait, ladies.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.760
If you're free tomorrow,

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.870
how about we go to Qu River together?

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.940
Sure.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.440
I've never been to Qu River before.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.220
It's a deal then.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.080
At 9 AM,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.120
let's meet at the entrance
of the Chengfo Temple.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.640
Don't be late.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.380
No problem.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.050
I had already planned to elope with Woody,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.960
just waiting for the right moment.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.030
The arrangement with you two

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.430
to go to Qu River together

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.770
was to disguise the fact

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.910
that I was betraying my mother,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.970
to make her believe

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.470
that my disappearance was an accident.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.320
Woody.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.200
Wu Yang's escape through the back window

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.930
was done with your help, right?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.270
If I had just left then,

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.270
none of the later events
would have happened.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.400
But I couldn't bear to leave my mother.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.870
I wanted one last look

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.770
at her performing the lion dance.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.510
So you knew all along

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.140
that Chi Ying is skilled at
the lion dance?

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.630
Yes.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.610
But Mother didn't want me to know,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.200
so I pretended I didn't.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.670
What a clever

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.120
little girl you are.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.320
Bravo! Bravo!

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.550
My father

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.390
was once a supervisor
at the Imperial Armory,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.910
just a ninth-rank official.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.040
Yet he was framed by ruthless officers

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.930
and wrongfully died in prison.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.970
I became an orphan,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.120
then fell into hardship,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.700
ending up as a sanitation worker.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.820
Wu Yang.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.720
That wandering hermit

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.080
asked me to bring you another letter.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.750
Do you want to hear it?

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.810
I'll read it to you.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:01.380
No.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.660
Do you want to reply?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.690
Just tell me.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.630
I'll write it down for you.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.370
Do you think

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.440
I should keep trusting him?

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.390
That guy is definitely no good.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.920
Then why do you still
deliver letters for him?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.320
Once you take someone's money,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.780
you have to keep your word.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.410
I have no choice.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.120
Is that the only reason?

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.450
Yes, it is.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.850
Then you may leave.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.490
Wu Yang.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.340
Don't be afraid.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.180
If that villain tries to harm you,

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.330
I'll protect you with my life.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.510
You've been delivering letters for him

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.310
because you want to use the chance
to see me, right?

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.720
I chose to leave this way

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.030
because I wanted Mother to believe

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.890
that I was kidnapped by a villain.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.130
This way,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.170
she would only hate the villain

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.960
instead of me,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.670
the daughter she raised with such care

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.400
and cherished like a treasure.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.020
But unexpectedly,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.520
there were actually villains,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.870
and more than one.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.320
As the saying goes,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.390
"the mantis stalks the cicada,
unaware of the oriole behind."

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.930
But in your case,

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.230
after the oriole comes a natural enemy,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.320
after the natural enemy comes a hunter,

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.080
and after the hunter...

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.120
There's Woody.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.200
Luckily, there's Woody,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.600
who's been secretly protecting me
all along

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.630
and never gave up.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:16:59.910
Woody,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.330
do you admit your guilt?

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:06.440
I...

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.900
You rescued Wu Yang at Qu River

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.000
but didn't take her home afterwards.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.440
That's considered abduction.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.589
It was my choice not to go home.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.319
It had nothing to do with Woody.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.210
This...

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.280
Woody,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.390
let me ask you.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.990
How did Wu Yang's clothes

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.000
end up

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.160
on another woman?

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.069
Well...

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.750
You provided clues multiple times,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.000
yet why didn't you report
Physician Bai's crime?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.920
I... I...

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.030
Woody,

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.880
that day, I asked you

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.110
where Physician Bai lived.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.620
Do you know where he lives?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.350
In Yongyang District,

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.680
right next to the Earth God Temple.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.170
You answered without hesitation,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.400
so I knew immediately

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.490
that you had been to his home.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.880
That was my idea.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.550
I didn't expect
that Physician Bai was also a villain.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.940
I heard him mention

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.640
he lives next to the Earth God Temple
in Yongyang District.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.770
While he's injured,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.680
come with me

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.100
to kill him,

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.240
so he can't hurt anyone else.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.640
Therefore, we followed him
to the Ghost Market.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.720
We were truly terrified,
seeing that corpse.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.590
Woody reminded me again
to report to the authorities.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.160
But when I calmed down, I thought

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.110
this was a perfect chance to escape,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.510
to make my mother believe

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.610
I was truly dead.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.200
So you personally

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.000
changed the corpse's clothes?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.010
Yes.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.970
I asked Woody to step away.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.600
Therefore, he's innocent.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.350
At that time,

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.870
I was truly trembling with fear.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.650
So I could only

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.040
protect Wu Yang from a distance.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.070
Wu Yang,

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.670
you've really got nerve.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.470
To leave Auntie Chi Ying,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.520
you've basically gone all‑in.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.570
I'll ask you one more time—

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.680
Woody,

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.920
do you admit your guilt?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.550
Wasn't everything just explained clearly?

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.950
But what did you do today?

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.790
According to the Tang Empire's law,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.450
abduction is a serious crime.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.510
I went with him of my own free will.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.790
How can you call that abduction?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.440
But if Chi Ying files a complaint,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.700
it becomes abduction.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.960
Officers.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.250
Ladies.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.410
Old man, buddy.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.000
I, Wu Yang, am begging you.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.460
Please let Woody and me go.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.600
My mother

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.570
treats me very well,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.530
and yet also very badly.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.240
I really don't want to be chained to her

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.370
for my whole life.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.350
I want to live according to my own wishes—

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.770
to dress as I like,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.990
to marry, to have children,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.220
and to live freely.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.640
If I can't have that, I'd rather die.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.100
I, Wu Yang, am begging you.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.310
Refusing to accept your fate.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.510
You're quite like me.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.840
Lu Lingfeng.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.960
Freedom

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.200
is everyone's right.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.640
Though letting Wu Yang go

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.780
would be too cruel to Auntie Chi Ying.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.360
But if I were her,

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.260
I might do the same.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.200
You two!

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.350
Alright, alright.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.270
Get up.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.760

Chi Ying from
following her daughter westward.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.030
It's just that the journey will be rough.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.960
Auntie Chi Ying,

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.510
if you go alone,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.360
we'll be worried about you.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.400
It's fine.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.240
Years ago, I was pregnant

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.200
when I ventured alone to Chang'an.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.780
It's getting late.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.100
Everyone, please go back.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.260
I'm off!

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.070
What are you smiling about?

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.350
Usually you're so quick-witted.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.960
Why didn't you say anything just now?

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960
Aren't you worried

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.690
Wu Yang will be confined again?

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.510
After these events,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.490
Chi Ying should have changed.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.490
Wu Yang

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.880
will also better understand
her mother's difficulties.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.680
Besides,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.110
this is a family matter.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.750
If Official Lu,
a dignified court official,

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.270
doesn't interfere,

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.730
how could I, a mere scholar

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.350

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.000
Things definitely won't be peaceful
in Hanzhou.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.160
It's just part of human life.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.510

[Autumn Journey on Horseback]

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.210
You're... Leaving Chang'an?

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.150
Yes.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.350
I heard early this morning
that Chi Ying had left.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.480
I'm going after her.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.590
[Autumn Journey on Horseback]

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.330
With just your legs,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.350
you won't be able to
catch up with Chi Ying.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.920
I'll travel more during the day

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.250
and sleep less at night.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.750
If I chase her for a few more days,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.480
sooner or later, I'll catch up.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.550
What about your lion dance troupe?

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.080
I've already disbanded it.

Xia Sheng.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.070
Once you leave Chang'an,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.400
I'm afraid making a living with lion dance

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.860
will be even harder.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.750
I'm aware of that.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.730
I'm over 50 now.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.060
I don't seek wealth or glory,

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.960
only to follow my heart

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.350
without hesitation.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.830
What you just said

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.210
genuinely earned

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.670
my admiration.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.460
Mr. Xia,

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.240
take my horse

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.920
and go after Chi Ying.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.590
But...

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.150
I've distributed all my money

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.550
to the young members
of my lion dance troupe.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.940
I cannot afford a horse.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.030
Who said anything about buying?

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.630
I'm giving it to you for free.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.070
Ride fast,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.500
and before sunset,

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.440
you'll surely catch up with Chi Ying.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.700
She's alone right now.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.070
This is exactly when she needs protection.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.470
But...

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.840
Official Lu is being so kind.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.360
Why don't you hurry up
and get on the horse?

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.040
Alright.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.170
Alright.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.000
Thank you.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.070
Thank you.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.350
I'm grateful.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.370
Truly amazing.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.520
That horse was truly a fine gift.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.010
I must say, Lu Lingfeng,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.010
spending more time with Xijun

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.480
has made you more and more compassionate.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.780
Hey, Fei.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.640
Your cooking lately

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.350
has been getting more and more bland.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.480
That can't be right.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.080
Oh no.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.270
I forgot to add salt to this dish.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.260
This dish is way too salty.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.890
I'm getting old.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.200
However,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.550
having a miracle doctor work as a cook

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.830
is truly a waste of talent.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.350
How about this?

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.190
Tomorrow, the Circuit Trials

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.970
will enter Chonghua District.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.290
You should go along.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.440
By then, Official Lu will handle
the Circuit Trials,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.400
and Miracle Doctor Fei
will enter the district for consultations.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.530
How does that sound?

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.510
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.600
I'm used to being carefree.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.800
If I have to follow the judicial office

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.860
into the district,

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.710
I wouldn't be able to bear

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.440
all those rules and protocols.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.280
Official Lu,

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.760
since he doesn't want to go,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.590
let's just forget about it then.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.969
Fine, forget about it.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.900
But tomorrow,

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.710
I happen to have an old friend

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.880
who's bringing me

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.320
a special recipe Gourd Chicken
to Chonghua District.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.320
I'm sure Fei wouldn't be interested.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:41.880
Hold on!

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320
I think Su Wuming's idea

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.870
is actually not bad.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.360
Look,

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.389

did the trick.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.040
to stay by Your Highness's side
day and night.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.360
There's one more thing.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.710
Lu Tong also went to Chonghua District.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.420
After that,

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.810
Official Lu followed him into the palace.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.740
Your Highness,

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.150
[Crucial Nexus]

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.950
Su Wuming requests an audience.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.290
Let him in.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:04.710
His Majesty is hosting a banquet

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.000
for the meritorious officials
who took part in

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.070
executing Deposed Queen Wei
as well as those who opposed her.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.480
He ordered me to draft the guest list,

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.070
so I went to Yongzhou Prefecture
to find you.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.960
Only then did I learn you had entered
the district to solve cases,

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.160
so I followed you to Chonghua District.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.590
Thank you for your trouble, Grand General.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.430
I heard that at the banquet,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.600
everyone will receive a reward.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.960
If you want to
return to the Imperial Guards,

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.620
don't miss this opportunity.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.200
While His Majesty
is in good spirits today,

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.570
make your request.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.910
Got it.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.030
[Rule Through the Music of the Zither]

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.430
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.760
Lu Lingfeng.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.130
It's your turn now.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.030
Three years ago,

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:46.800
you always stayed my side protecting me.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.820
That scene

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.760
feels like it was just yesterday.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.290
Go ahead.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.730
What reward do you want from me?

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.920
I earnestly request Your Majesty

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.380
to grace Chengfo Temple
with your presence.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.480
His Majesty asked what reward you want,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.540
and yet you're asking His Majesty
to go worship Buddha?

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.370
Have you had too much to drink?

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:19.840
Since I became

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.550
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.030
the first case I've handled

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.490
involves Chengfo Temple.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.920
You don't ask me for
your own career advancement,

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.000
but for the religious worship
of Chengfo Temple?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.710
In my heart,

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.320
it's not just about religious worship.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.940
It's about the very realm and state
of our Tang Empire.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.070
Now, rumors are spreading everywhere,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.190
and people are in panic.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.250
If this continues,

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.250
Chang'an will not be at peace!

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.970
How dare you!
