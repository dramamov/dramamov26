Look.

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:45.513
Such thunder!

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:46.233
Yeah.

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:49.674
What's in the sky?

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:51.473
What is that?

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:52.754
Let's see.

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:54.513
It's covered.

00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:56.553
Look.

(Xue Street)

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.674
T-The auspicious sign.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.593
Heaven's blessing descends.

00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:05.593
Heaven is showing us the chosen one.

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:06.634
He is Jia Xun.

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:08.353
What about His Majesty?

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:12.314
- I've never seen this.
- Yeah.

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:15.793
This is the auspicious sign?

00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:17.793
No way.

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:19.954
Nice fireworks.

00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:24.394
An auspicious omen.

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:26.834
The rightful ruler returns.

00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:29.554
Your Majesty.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.754
- Hail the rightful ruler!
- Hail the rightful ruler!

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:55.914
Am I doomed

00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.754
by heaven?

00:03:07.873 --> 00:03:09.713
W-What's happening?

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:11.353
Xue Guardian, Miss Feng?

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:12.274
- Yeah.
- Yes.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:13.674
Why was she arrested?

00:03:13.754 --> 00:03:14.954
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:17.314
No idea.

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:18.873
Something is off.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:31.593
Feng Zuoren, you fiend.

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:34.954
For years, you've been Jia Ji's lackey!

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:37.873
How many loyal officials
have you killed?

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:40.834
How many innocents have you slaughtered?

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:44.153
Today, I, the Grand Tutor,

00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:46.834
will deliver heaven's justice

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.433
and execute you bloodthirsty monster.

00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:51.993
Execute her.

00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:08.680
What...

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:09.713
- What's this?
- The sky!

00:04:09.713 --> 00:04:10.433
What's happening?

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:12.233
The color changed.

00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:13.593
What evil spirit is this?

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:14.314
Yeah.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:17.913
Why has the sky turned like this?

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:18.674
Indeed.

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:20.473
It's completely different.

00:04:20.753 --> 00:04:21.714
What omen is this?

00:04:23.753 --> 00:04:24.874
He's causing this.

00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:26.233
Something's wrong.

00:04:26.793 --> 00:04:27.313
Yeah.

00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:30.353
How did this happen?

00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:33.233
Let me in.

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:35.313
Don't close the door.

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:37.154
Open up.

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:38.594
(Xue Street)
This is no blessing.

00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:39.793
A demon's coming to earth.

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:40.554
Yeah.

00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:42.033
A demon has come.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:43.114
Why did it turn dark?

00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:46.154
I-I'm scared.

00:04:46.313 --> 00:04:47.274
Don't be scared.

00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:53.473
It worked.

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:57.834
I mixed saltpeter, sulfur,
and platinum powder

00:04:58.434 --> 00:04:59.473
into the fireworks

00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:01.313
and induced thunder.

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:02.154
So it worked.

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:08.874
W-What...

00:05:09.154 --> 00:05:10.114
What's in the sky?

00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:15.633
This is no auspicious sign.

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:17.394
It's a celestial warning.

00:05:18.073 --> 00:05:19.674
Grand Tutor Zhou and this sorcerer

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:20.714
spread treasonous lies.

00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:22.513
Even the heavens rage.

00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:23.554
You traitor!

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:24.793
Nonsense!

00:05:24.913 --> 00:05:26.954
Guards! Protect His Majesty!

00:05:27.274 --> 00:05:30.154
Arrest Zhou and the rebel sorcerer!

00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:36.434
Do something.

00:05:40.114 --> 00:05:40.994
Get His Majesty out.

00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:41.674
Understood.

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:48.633
T-This can't...

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.274
Here.

00:06:27.473 --> 00:06:28.360
Get Xue Youshou.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.448
I'll protect His Majesty.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.554
Stop struggling.

00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:47.473
Feng.

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:49.274
Miss Feng.

00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:52.033
Can't bear to let me go?

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:56.360
Hand over the jade pendant.

00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:01.513
I'll make it quick.

00:07:04.994 --> 00:07:05.513
You are

00:07:06.353 --> 00:07:07.594
so heartless.

00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:11.073
When you thought
I was the former Crown Prince,

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:12.994
you admired and protected me

00:07:13.674 --> 00:07:14.714
with all your heart.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:16.073
You wouldn't

00:07:16.193 --> 00:07:17.554
even expose my plan of usurpation.

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:19.834
I haven't changed.

00:07:20.594 --> 00:07:21.874
I'm still me.

00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:26.913
But my status is no longer noble.

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:29.434
It's you who changed.

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:34.714
Don't try to gaslight me.

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:37.274
If you've always been yourself,

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.793
why pretend to be someone else?

00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:42.633
Because you know you're doomed

00:07:43.274 --> 00:07:45.513
to live like a sewer rat on your own.

00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:50.193
Miss Feng, don't be angry.

00:07:50.793 --> 00:07:51.594
You'll age faster.

00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:53.874
You want the jade pendant?

00:07:56.954 --> 00:07:57.913
Take it then.

00:08:59.113 --> 00:08:59.753
Feng.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:00.834
I failed to retrieve

00:09:02.154 --> 00:09:03.513
your jade pendant.

00:09:05.794 --> 00:09:06.313
I know.

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.392
Let's treat your wounds.

00:09:10.234 --> 00:09:11.154
I'll reclaim

00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:12.433
what's mine.

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:22.394
Xue Hexu.

00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:24.993
Can't you two

00:09:25.073 --> 00:09:26.633
save the romance for later?

00:09:28.474 --> 00:09:29.416
His Majesty is fine.

00:09:29.513 --> 00:09:30.394
Those two rebels...

00:09:31.394 --> 00:09:33.834
have escaped.

00:09:39.034 --> 00:09:40.914
Grand Tutor Zhou won't give up.

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:42.834
Keep looking for them.

00:09:44.113 --> 00:09:44.712
Oh, right.

00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:47.154
I saw Jing'an Bureau agents
heading to the prison.

00:09:47.714 --> 00:09:50.154
Did you convince His Majesty
to spare the Xue family?

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:51.513
No.

00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:54.834
Oh, no.

00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:17.474
Open up.

00:10:17.753 --> 00:10:18.274
Who are you?

00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.553
Recognize the Jing'an Bureau tablet?

00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:22.474
Open it.

00:10:23.354 --> 00:10:23.993
Understood.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.354
Did Stepmother send help?

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:33.633
By imperial decree.

00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:35.474
Lord Dingyuan's whole family

00:10:35.673 --> 00:10:37.193
deceived His Majesty

00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:38.433
and shall be executed

00:10:39.313 --> 00:10:40.154
immediately.

00:10:40.553 --> 00:10:43.193
Aren't you Jing'an Bureau agents
under Grand Tutor Zhou?

00:10:44.113 --> 00:10:47.594
Grand Tutor Zhou sent you here, huh?

00:10:47.753 --> 00:10:48.873
You'll soon be dead.

00:10:49.553 --> 00:10:50.834
Why do you care?

00:10:52.113 --> 00:10:52.633
Do it.

00:10:53.394 --> 00:10:54.873
Try it if you dare!

00:10:55.513 --> 00:10:57.433
Dongyang, protect our family.

00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:02.753
- Father.
- Father.

00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:03.354
Kill them.

00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:04.073
Stop.

00:11:05.113 --> 00:11:05.672
Father.

00:11:07.073 --> 00:11:07.624
Father.

00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:09.794
- My son.
- Are you alright?

00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:10.394
My boy.

00:11:10.914 --> 00:11:11.513
Are you okay?

00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:12.714
I'm fine.

00:11:13.394 --> 00:11:13.914
Father.

00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:17.553
Hexu.

00:11:17.753 --> 00:11:18.408
Father.

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:20.873
I regret lying

00:11:21.474 --> 00:11:22.193
and worrying you.

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:24.954
Hexu, don't be silly.

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:26.954
You're alive.

00:11:27.433 --> 00:11:29.954
Now I can face
the late Empress without shame.

00:11:31.034 --> 00:11:31.553
Father,

00:11:32.113 --> 00:11:33.474
I owe you my life.

00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:36.034
I won't leave

00:11:36.234 --> 00:11:37.073
without you

00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:38.034
or our family.

00:11:39.313 --> 00:11:39.976
Hexu.

00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:42.513
Are you really the...

00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:43.753
I am only a member

00:11:44.553 --> 00:11:45.313
of the Xue family.

00:11:45.394 --> 00:11:46.354
Enough talking!

00:11:47.513 --> 00:11:48.193
Perfect.

00:11:48.354 --> 00:11:49.954
The whole family is here.

00:11:50.113 --> 00:11:50.954
You'll die together.

00:11:51.474 --> 00:11:52.073
Kill them.

00:11:52.073 --> 00:11:53.553
Grand Tutor Zhou is rebelling.

00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:58.274
Will you still follow his lead?

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.313
We're just following orders.

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:03.993
If we spare them today,

00:12:04.193 --> 00:12:05.834
we'll be killed tomorrow.

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:07.313
Besides,

00:12:09.113 --> 00:12:09.834
Gu Qianfu,

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:12.354
I thought you were dead.

00:12:14.154 --> 00:12:15.394
I donated

00:12:18.873 --> 00:12:21.313
a whole string of coins at your funeral.

00:12:21.714 --> 00:12:22.234
What?

00:12:24.394 --> 00:12:25.553
That was my funeral.

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:29.394
He actually charged you for it?

00:12:32.354 --> 00:12:33.834
Despicable man.

00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:36.553
It seems

00:12:37.954 --> 00:12:39.513
it won't be easy to get

00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:41.834
my 3000 liang pension back.

00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:43.794
Are you done?

00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:46.193
You should know

00:12:46.673 --> 00:12:48.394
Grand Tutor Zhou very well.

00:12:49.474 --> 00:12:50.193
A man like him

00:12:50.794 --> 00:12:51.834
is utterly self-serving

00:12:52.234 --> 00:12:53.154
and greed-blinded.

00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:54.513
He defied authority

00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:55.944
and killed other officials.

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:58.274
His Majesty has ordered his arrest.

00:12:58.714 --> 00:13:00.193
Will you keep serving

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:01.794
that evil man?

00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:03.912
But...

00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:07.794
How can we

00:13:08.234 --> 00:13:09.513
get out of this situation?

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:11.113
I'm the one who released them.

00:13:11.633 --> 00:13:13.034
You know nothing about it.

00:13:24.234 --> 00:13:25.354
Mother, it's over.

00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:29.474
Father.

00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:31.394
Miss Feng kept saying you were alive,

00:13:32.073 --> 00:13:33.513
but I couldn't rest assured

00:13:34.954 --> 00:13:35.914
without seeing you.

00:13:37.474 --> 00:13:38.193
This is great.

00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:39.113
Hexu is back.

00:13:39.313 --> 00:13:40.474
We are together again.

00:13:45.873 --> 00:13:46.834
Where's Youshou?

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:51.313
Grandmother.

00:13:52.154 --> 00:13:52.914
Youshou

00:13:54.714 --> 00:13:56.234
fled with Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:13:59.993 --> 00:14:00.616
Father.

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:01.954
Go home first.

00:14:02.914 --> 00:14:03.633
I'll handle this.

00:14:09.122 --> 00:14:11.624
(Xue Mansion)

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:18.433
Stay hidden.

00:14:19.154 --> 00:14:20.234
I'm not done yet.

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:22.394
What if someone finds out?

00:14:36.873 --> 00:14:37.834
I don't blame others.

00:14:40.034 --> 00:14:42.633
I only curse my own mercy and weakness.

00:14:44.993 --> 00:14:45.993
Had I known,

00:14:48.873 --> 00:14:51.034
I should've killed Xue Hexu long ago.

00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:53.794
Then I wouldn't be

00:14:55.313 --> 00:14:56.714
facing ruin now.

00:14:58.954 --> 00:15:00.954
Stop talking nonsense.

00:15:02.794 --> 00:15:05.193
Hexu has never mistreated you.

00:15:06.474 --> 00:15:08.433
Why would you kill your brother?

00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:17.113
Is he truly my brother?

00:15:19.073 --> 00:15:19.834
Grandmother.

00:15:21.834 --> 00:15:24.313
He's a remnant of the fallen dynasty.

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:26.954
You still don't repent!

00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:38.113
Youshou.

00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:43.714
My poor grandson.

00:15:44.113 --> 00:15:46.073
My silly grandson.

00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:49.274
How did you become like this?

00:16:01.834 --> 00:16:02.673
Listen to me.

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:04.993
The most dangerous place

00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:06.753
is also the safest.

00:16:07.313 --> 00:16:09.193
You are safe here.

00:16:09.474 --> 00:16:10.594
After this blows over,

00:16:13.234 --> 00:16:14.154
take these...

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.232
(Banknote)

00:16:18.234 --> 00:16:19.474
and run away to Liang.

00:16:27.034 --> 00:16:27.753
Grandmother.

00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:31.313
It's all his fault.

00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:34.633
Otherwise, I would be

00:16:35.513 --> 00:16:37.073
sitting on the throne now.

00:16:38.313 --> 00:16:40.113
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:41.704
You...

00:16:41.873 --> 00:16:44.633
How long will you keep wavering?

00:16:54.354 --> 00:16:55.354
The bad news is

00:16:55.474 --> 00:16:57.954
that people see you as a cursed ruler.

00:17:00.873 --> 00:17:01.834
The good news is

00:17:02.274 --> 00:17:03.753
that I've deployed imperial guards

00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:04.954
who support us.

00:17:05.994 --> 00:17:06.874
We can

00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:09.033
give it a go.

00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:13.714
No more hesitation.

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:16.714
Your indecisiveness

00:17:17.114 --> 00:17:19.354
left us surrounded by enemies.

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:20.393
No.

00:17:21.553 --> 00:17:23.433
You can't kill His Majesty.

00:17:23.994 --> 00:17:25.273
Even if you do,

00:17:25.793 --> 00:17:28.474
will regional governments
obey your decrees?

00:17:29.514 --> 00:17:32.514
People have witnessed celestial omens.

00:17:32.714 --> 00:17:35.433
They'll never
acknowledge you as Emperor.

00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:40.273
If we delay further,

00:17:41.433 --> 00:17:42.393
not just me,

00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:45.793
the whole family will be implicated.

00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:47.114
I absolutely forbid it.

00:17:47.954 --> 00:17:49.634
If you dare launch a coup,

00:17:50.114 --> 00:17:51.994
I'll expel you from the Xue family.

00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:54.114
From then on,

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:55.474
you won't be

00:17:55.594 --> 00:17:57.474
a member of this family.

00:17:59.754 --> 00:18:00.514
Old Madam Xue.

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.153
Why can't you understand?

00:18:04.073 --> 00:18:05.393
If he becomes Emperor,

00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:07.153
your family becomes royalty.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:08.954
It's all gain...

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:09.514
Pah!

00:18:10.754 --> 00:18:12.313
Who do you think you are?

00:18:12.874 --> 00:18:15.553
How dare you bark before me?

00:18:16.874 --> 00:18:18.754
You old hag. How dare you insult me!

00:18:20.073 --> 00:18:20.793
I-I must...

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.514
I... Youshou...

00:18:23.514 --> 00:18:24.754
Give it to me.

00:18:25.474 --> 00:18:26.153
Get lost.

00:18:44.433 --> 00:18:45.032
You...

00:18:45.594 --> 00:18:47.193
W-What kind of staff technique is this?

00:18:47.673 --> 00:18:48.754
Dog-Beating Staff.

00:18:49.433 --> 00:18:51.153
I may have aged,

00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:53.634
but I can still beat a scum like you.

00:18:54.114 --> 00:18:54.664
You...

00:18:55.153 --> 00:18:56.994
The traitor is inside. Catch him.

00:19:01.553 --> 00:19:02.114
Old hag.

00:19:02.634 --> 00:19:03.514
You'll regret this.

00:19:05.874 --> 00:19:06.393
Youshou.

00:19:06.994 --> 00:19:08.153
Come with me.

00:19:31.994 --> 00:19:32.594
Grandmother.

00:19:32.994 --> 00:19:33.754
- Grandmother.
- Are you hurt?

00:19:33.874 --> 00:19:34.474
Take this.

00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:37.073
Where are the guards?

00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:38.913
Grand Tutor Zhou is launching a coup.

00:19:39.393 --> 00:19:40.033
Get him.

00:19:40.634 --> 00:19:41.994
There are no guards.

00:19:42.193 --> 00:19:44.273
Dongyang and I did puppet shadows.

00:19:54.474 --> 00:19:55.176
Youshou.

00:19:55.673 --> 00:19:56.393
Let's split up.

00:19:57.193 --> 00:19:58.073
Meet in two hours

00:19:58.433 --> 00:19:59.273
at the usual spot.

00:19:59.553 --> 00:20:00.033
Alright.

00:20:10.673 --> 00:20:11.354
You came.

00:20:12.393 --> 00:20:13.474
I've been waiting.

00:20:16.193 --> 00:20:17.313
Give me my jade pendant.

00:20:19.754 --> 00:20:20.634
If you dare,

00:20:21.234 --> 00:20:22.313
try to take it.

00:20:33.234 --> 00:20:34.153
Here I am.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.393
I used to be an illusionist.

00:20:52.754 --> 00:20:53.954
Have you forgotten?

00:21:04.874 --> 00:21:05.714
Xue Youshou.

00:21:07.193 --> 00:21:08.714
Settle debts with those responsible.

00:21:09.673 --> 00:21:10.754
Take revenge on me

00:21:10.994 --> 00:21:11.793
and the Emperor.

00:21:12.553 --> 00:21:14.153
But you shouldn't have impersonated

00:21:14.433 --> 00:21:15.514
Young Master,

00:21:16.033 --> 00:21:17.114
or hurt Feng

00:21:17.114 --> 00:21:18.114
and the Xue family!

00:21:19.754 --> 00:21:20.553
That's right.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:23.913
I could've stayed safe as Mr. Immortal

00:21:24.553 --> 00:21:26.313
and waited for the Emperor to die.

00:21:26.714 --> 00:21:28.754
Grand Tutor would've
gotten what he wanted.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.273
And I'd become the Emperor.

00:21:30.754 --> 00:21:33.354
So why did I put on this show?

00:21:33.994 --> 00:21:35.994
Because I can't stand your happiness.

00:21:36.954 --> 00:21:39.433
I've suffered
loneliness and displacement.

00:21:40.273 --> 00:21:42.474
Meanwhile, you're such a happy family.

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:43.474
That's not fair!

00:21:44.153 --> 00:21:45.433
I want to watch

00:21:45.474 --> 00:21:47.033
as you lose those you love.

00:21:47.834 --> 00:21:49.793
I want to see you and Xue Fugui

00:21:49.954 --> 00:21:50.913
writhing in agony,

00:21:50.994 --> 00:21:52.553
wishing for death.

00:21:54.114 --> 00:21:54.913
And even then,

00:21:55.193 --> 00:21:57.193
it won't satisfy my desire for revenge.

00:22:03.193 --> 00:22:04.033
You're just

00:22:04.714 --> 00:22:06.994
planning to throw me
into the water again.

00:22:08.594 --> 00:22:09.393
But listen.

00:22:09.754 --> 00:22:11.313
I'm not the same person anymore.

00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:12.634
True,

00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:15.273
and neither am I.

00:22:22.354 --> 00:22:23.193
(Give me two liang.)

00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:25.954
(I'll teach you a defense move.)

00:22:51.114 --> 00:22:51.834
The jade pendant.

00:23:03.138 --> 00:23:06.754
♪Night clouds blush crimson,
yet fingertips miss their touch♪

00:23:08.514 --> 00:23:09.234
I got it back.

00:23:11.273 --> 00:23:12.273
How did you get it back?

00:23:13.073 --> 00:23:13.834
Are you hurt?

00:23:13.954 --> 00:23:14.634
- Let me see.
- Rest.

00:23:14.634 --> 00:23:16.417
♪Imprisoned within♪

00:23:18.172 --> 00:23:21.826
♪Believers and I bow low,
whose devotion rings true♪

00:23:22.044 --> 00:23:25.165
♪Who craves immortality?
Who begs for dreams♪

00:23:29.514 --> 00:23:31.234
When I gave you this pendant,

00:23:32.913 --> 00:23:33.474
I didn't know

00:23:34.474 --> 00:23:35.393
we'd face so much.

00:23:38.114 --> 00:23:39.193
Just like the jade pendant,

00:23:39.834 --> 00:23:40.754
you and I

00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:44.073
have found each other again.

00:23:45.745 --> 00:23:47.490
♪No confession needed♪

00:23:49.058 --> 00:23:52.994
♪Doubt that mortal sorrows linger,

00:23:53.506 --> 00:23:57.016
♪The world's weight

00:23:57.448 --> 00:24:04.108
♪Wanderers and old ghosts,

00:24:04.322 --> 00:24:08.386
♪Your gazes hold countless worlds,
