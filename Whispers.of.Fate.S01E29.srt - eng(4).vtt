[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.930
[Episode 29]

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.430
What's this?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.560
Senior,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.880
why don't we

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.680
just forget it?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.710
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.440
I didn't mean it that way.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.200
I'm just a bit curious—

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.680
how have you managed to survive until now?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.000
You have a heart-withering disease.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.640
This is a terminal illness

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.950
that even I can't cure.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.150
Tell me

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.860
which doctor you've seen.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.200
I haven't seen a doctor.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.520
That's weird.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.310
There's a strange energy

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.750
inside your body.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.280
Did you experience something unusual

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.590
when you were a child,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.920
or accidentally eat something?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.430
Think carefully.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.470
This way I can find

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.400
a breakthrough.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.120
Then this illness

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.650
won't be terminal anymore.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.800
But...

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.360
I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.079
can't remember.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.270
Actually, when I took your pulse earlier,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.730
I found poor blood circulation
in your head.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.760
It's quite strange.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640
You've lost your memory.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.400
What?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.680
When I used the Xuluo needle

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530
to stimulate your Yuzhen acupoint,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.660
you had no reaction.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.610
This is a symptom of memory loss.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.079
I can't remember.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.560
Perhaps

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.310
they're painful memories

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.030
of wandering around and begging.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.990
And I deliberately forgot them.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.910
It seems

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.910
these memories,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.090
whether I have them or not,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.530
don't matter to me.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.960
Senior.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.850
I'm satisfied with my life now.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.880
That's your personal business.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.380
I'll keep your secret.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.950
But as a doctor,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.050
I must remind you

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.829
your heart-withering disease
hasn't been fully cured.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.490
The reason you're still alive

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.890
is that the energy in your blood

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.280
is constantly healing you.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.060
Once you lose that energy,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.780
the disease will return and be fatal.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.920
I understand.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.990
Why can't I...

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.050
Let me help you.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.000
Thanks.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.650
Give me that one.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.680
Here.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.450
This one is better.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.830
Okay.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.040
A bit higher. More to the left.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.800
Is this good?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.200
Yes, that's about right.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.390
Chi.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.750
This is for the ancestors.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.680
If you want some,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.000
get some from the stove.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.750
The weather is nice today.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.159
Good weather.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.630
May everything go well.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.360
Shen.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.800
Shen.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.830
Is this for me?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.750
You...

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.410
Let's go celebrate the New Year.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.330
Alright.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.500
Shei's cook is excellent.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.600
Delicious.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.220
Come give me a hand.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.000
Be careful.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.860
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.120
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.520
No need for formalities.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.160
Be careful.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.900
Be careful.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.350
Got it.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.000
Let me do it.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.210
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.950
I'm just passing by to have a look.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.950
Go ahead.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.360
Yes.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.870
Take it slow.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.670
Wrap one more.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.430
Like this.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.680
Look at them.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.790
They long for eternity,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.800
yet they indulge in this fleeting,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.950
ephemeral beauty.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.960
The intimacy of this moment,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.090
when sudden misfortune strikes,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.140
will fade away like these fireworks

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.070
growing cold in the darkness.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.920
What are you saying, Your Highness?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.560
Nothing.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.240
I've heard that during the festival,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.190
people release lanterns on the river

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.430
to pray for good weather,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.690
happiness, and peace.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:11.950
If lovers

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.800
write their wishes on the lanterns

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.660
that float across the River of Hearts,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.720
the river god will hear their wishes.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.730
From then on,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.150
they can be together forever,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.480
through life and death.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.090
When it truly becomes
a matter of life and death,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.390
people always have to make choices.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.210
I spoke out of turn.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.240
Except for him.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.370
No matter how dangerous,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.960
he would never give up.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.090
Your Highness.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.130
Let's go.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.580
Happy New Year.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.940
Happy New Year.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.050
I have something

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.390
I'd like to speak to you alone.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.320
Alright.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.480
Everyone, please leave us.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.320
Yes.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.180
Your Highness, you have become

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.640
more and more commanding.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.390
Ms. Zhong,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.840
are there

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.540
any important imperial court matters?

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.530
Do I need a reason

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.030
to talk

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.200
to you?

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.280
Do you remember

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.270
when we first met?

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.180
What did you think of me then?

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.670
What a spirited and valiant lady.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.000
And now?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.400
Do you still think so?

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.790
I still do.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.150
When I was in the palace,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.690
my mother would often bring

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.740
gold, jade, fine embroidery,

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.350
and rare treasures to see me.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.010
She would ask what I wanted.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.260
I wanted to return quickly
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.590
I wanted to see you soon.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.200
Since I have promised your master,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.720
as long as the Fengliu Shop remains,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.120
I will not rashly leave.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.550
Besides,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.200
you and I are friends.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.440
Even if someday

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.910
I leave the Sword Alliance,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.270
I would still welcome you

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.260
to visit the Wanqiao Chamber.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.770
Do you truly not understand what I mean?

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.390
Ms. Zhong.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.440
I am not an ordinary person.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.200
I know.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.030
No,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.550
you don't.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.750
I

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.600
was deliberately created.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.390
What do you mean?

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.330
I was born in a place

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.720
you can't possibly imagine.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.130
In my childhood,

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.950
I was trained to kill.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.070
The person who created me

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.130
didn't allow me to have emotions.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.870
The world I could see

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.240
was just one room

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.630
and one corridor.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.420
At the end of that corridor

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.650
was endless slaughter.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.680
It was bright there,

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.050
but with less light than here.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.450
I dreamed of the outside world.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.590
With my only toy,

00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.620
a carving knife,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.550
I carved

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.540
all the things I imagined.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.090
I risked my life

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.630
to escape from that place.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.270
I can't believe

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.140
such places exist in this world.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.570
Of course they do exist.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:15.960
I

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.260
share the same origin

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.140
as Yique Yinyang.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.350
And just like Yique Yinyang,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.410
I don't understand emotions.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.530
How could you...

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.880
How could you be anything like him?

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.080
I can disregard

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.610
others' lives and deaths.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.200
Because I truly don't care.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.920
I save people

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.780
only because it's convenient.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.580
But you care about Chi Yun.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.390
You care about everyone.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.390
You care about us.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.910
This is what I learned

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.770
from Fang Zhou.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:01.960
But

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.360
Fang Zhou never taught me

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.960
how to love someone.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.240
You're lying.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:11.560
Even Chi Yun

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.890
has never heard of this.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.320
That's because I

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.120
wasn't willing to say it before.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240
I pretended

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.550
that I had forgotten everything.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.520
I marked the beginning of my life

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.960
as the day I met Fang Zhou

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.120
at Zhoudi Tower.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.600
Since you told me these things,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.360
does it prove

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.150
that I am

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.690
somewhat different from them?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.800
Wounds aren't frightening.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.310
What scares people

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.000
is the pain.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
But one can't avoid treating wounds

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.440
just because they hurt.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.200

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.740

Mr. Tang, please go back.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.960

Careful.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.780
Stone is really amazing.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.870
Stone, you forgot the lantern.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.400
Catch it.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.460
Stone, stay calm.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.600
Stay calm.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.840
Maybe we should

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.970
keep our distance.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.220
No.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.080
What's wrong?

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.800
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.030
Let me see.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.030
Master.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.000
Master.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.030
I...

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.320
I knocked over

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.460
the stone stack again.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.200
Stone.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.520
You didn't knock it over.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.150
Do you have scissors?

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.550
Yes.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:49.840
Mr. Tang,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.550
what are you going to do?

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.720
Mr. Tang is so skillful.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.370
Indeed.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.109
Look.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.270
That's amazing.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.650
It's beautiful.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.000
This way we can

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.859
seal that hole.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.400
He cut it so well.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.830
Does it look nice?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.680
It's really beautiful.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.480
Yes.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.480
Master.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.920
Let's go home.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.440
Okay.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.480
Master,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.680
look.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.420
Did you draw this?

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.030
Stone.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.350
Do you like Miss Shei?

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:23.880
I like her.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.590
Shei

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.330
cooks delicious food.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.640
She's nice

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.510
to me.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.270
I like her

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.880
just as I like you.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.310
Stone,

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.340
you've learned how to flatter others now.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.680
I really

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.920
like you.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.980
Mr. Tang, you're back.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640
Shei.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.160
Look.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.490
I drew something.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.720
It's very good.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.200
Stone,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.920
it's time for practice.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.830
No practice today.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.070
We are

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.430
going out.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.270
Going out?

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:25.960
Let's go out

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.070
to celebrate the New Year.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.690
Let's go.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.440
It's rare to see you

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.000
willing to come out and walk.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.440
When we were at Jinye Temple,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.790
you never wanted to go out.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.160
I was recovering then.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.920
What is the New Year?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.550
New Year

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.830
is when the whole family gathers

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.400
and enjoys themselves.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.540
That's what the New Year is about.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.160
Here.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.350
Thank you, Sir.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.590
Here's the money.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.880
Take care.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.070
Dad, let's go over there.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.840
Shei.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.640
I want that.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.640
Okay.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.920
Shei.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.170
I want to eat that.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:41.960
Here you go.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.560
Thank you.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.490
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.240
Sir, give me two more skewers.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:50.900
Sure thing.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.410
Alright.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.720
You all have one now?

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.360
Let's look around up ahead.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.880
Great!

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.400
Great.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:14.920
Look.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.800
Great!

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.760
Let's go, Stone.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.660
Let me take you to try it.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:29.350
No.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.000
That's for kids.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.840
You...

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.010
How old do you think you are?

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.140
Aren't you a kid too?

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.690
Let's go.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.440
Sir!

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.350
How much

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.340
for one turn?

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.480
This much.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:41.880
Play as much as you like.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.240
Deal.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:42.870
Come on.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.360
Let's go check it out?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:58.730
Let's go.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.350
Take your time.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.750
Okay.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.220
Shen, you should try it too.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.360
I feel that you

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.120
seem a bit strange today.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.440
Strange how?

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.510
I can't quite put my finger on it.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.440
But you're different from before.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.480
Perhaps it's because we've called a truce

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.750
with the Fengliu Shop,

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.180
and it's a holiday,

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.610
so I'm in a good mood.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.850
River lanterns.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.750
Yes.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.830
There's a tradition
of floating river lanterns here.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.890
During festivals,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:36.790
people

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.070
write their wishes

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.160
on these lanterns.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.200
They light them and let them drift away,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.880
praying

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.570
that the river god will hear their wishes

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.330
and make them come true.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.310
I see.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.070
Sir,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.940
why not buy a lantern for your wife?

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.910
I'm not.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.380
Does that mean I can't buy one?

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.660
What wish are you going to make?

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.190
You've thought for so long.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.960
I hope

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.370
to destroy the Fengliu Shop soon.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.830
I wish Chi,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.730
Shen, Ms. Zhong,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.390
Stone, Master Shao, and Mr. Gu

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.010
safe and sound.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.000
You can just

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.080
make this kind of wish to me.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.670
Why trouble the heavens?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.540
Think of something

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.450
that you want for yourself.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.400
Then I wish

wishes for yourself.

It's so late.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.590
What important matter brings you here?

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.400
Regarding what you mentioned last time,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.790
about me and Fang Zhou,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.480
I have made up my mind.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.960
So you've decided

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.750
to remove this heart crystal

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.080
and keep your own heart?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.790
I hope you can

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.000
preserve this heart crystal.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.890
Are you sure?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.400
I've told you before.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480
Fang Zhou's heart crystal has already

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.280
connected with your bloodline.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.270
If you want to preserve
this heart crystal,

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.990
even with your special constitution,

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.470
you will certainly die.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.590
I know.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.270
You're surprised

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.590
that I chose to save others

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.300
over myself?

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.760
You should leave.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.620
I'm a healer, not an executioner.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.400
I can't agree to a patient's request

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.000
that leads to certain death.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.790
Senior.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.720
You really shouldn't have

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.930
such misplaced compassion

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.050
and mercy for me.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.160
You are indeed not an executioner,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.240
but neither are you

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.440
the princess's maid.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:00.930
Isn't that right,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.350
Princess Xi Ya?

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.350
Yique Yinyang used heavenly fire

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.440
to burn down the entire Gumo State.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.160
Yet he spared the only one

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.690
who had shown him kindness—

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.200
Princess Xi Ya.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.200
I want to know

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.240
what made you

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.370
make this decision.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.200
At Mount Baojing,

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.970
you asked me to save you.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.200
I'd like to know,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.830
after I made

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:47.720
such a request,

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.640
why you hesitated.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.640
I asked you first.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.030
You should answer me first.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:54.830
If your reason

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.750
satisfies me,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.740
I might be willing to grant your wish.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.280
You must grant my wish.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.750
Otherwise,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:04.590
Shenzhou will be destroyed

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.830
by a catastrophe.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:07.960
What do you mean?

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.510
Ye Mo is still alive.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.360
What?

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.600
How is that possible?

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.080
How is that possible?

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.480
I suspect

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.290
he used the secret technique
of the Tianren Realm

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.730
to preserve his spirit.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.720
Once he finds a suitable vessel,

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.330
he can be reborn.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.120
That's why he's been looking for me
all along.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.950
But just because of this suspicion,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.240
you're willing to give up your life?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.330
I was born in bloodshed.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.070
This Tianren body I've cultivated

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.180
is so coveted by Yique Yinyang.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.370
It must have tremendous value.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.090
So I'll destroy it.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.920
Let all his scheming

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.760

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.969
Wouldn't that be amusing?

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.290

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.970
Fang Zhou's puppet.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.110
But I always

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:12.630
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.430
couldn't bring myself to start.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.220
Only because I didn't understand

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.680
what he was thinking in that white haze

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:23.760
as death approached.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.070
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.710
I wasn't ready

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.250
to say goodbye to him.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.190
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.030
But now,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:43.870
I understand.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.880
I can now

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.880
carve his face,

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:48.760
because I've finally

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.560
prepared myself to say goodbye.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.000
Senior,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.890
after Fang Zhou is revived,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.250
please give this

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.930
to him for me.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:15.010
♪ The breeze blows through the pleats ♪

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.810
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.030
Please.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:39.180
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.720
Is there anything else you want to say?

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.880
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.810
Remind Fang Zhou

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.380
that Ghostly Peony

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.920
is the mastermind

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.850
behind the Fengliu Shop incident.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.880
His relationship with Yique Yinyang

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.940
is far from simple.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.440
In fact,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.800
he might be

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.400
Yique Yinyang's vessel

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.330
for his remaining consciousness.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.840
However,

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.600
I'll just leave the trouble

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.670
to Fang Zhou.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.630
Anything else?

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.410
About yourself?

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.510
Bury me

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.000
in Zhoudi Tower.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.000
Please

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.960
say goodbye to everyone

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.150
for me.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:50.920
And also,

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:53.880
I'm sorry.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.970
At the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.590
I heard rumors about you.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.400
Mr. Tang, you're brilliant, formidable,

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.860
generous, and righteous.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.650
Though your methods are unconventional,

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.250
you're willing to save others

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.410
at your own risk.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.730
That's why I hesitated.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:18.960
Thank you.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:42.150
Hurry.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.280
Happy New Year!

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.050
Happy New Year.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.960
Happy New Year.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.690
What a feast.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.360
Chi,

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.520
wait for Master.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.150
So strong?

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.980
Okay, okay.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.710
Where is Mr. Tang?

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.350
Maybe he has gone out.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.340
Going out on the first day
of the lunar year?

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:20.920
Where to?

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.590
Visiting relatives?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.370
It'll burn you.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.840
Boring.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.130
He'll come back eventually.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.830
That's right.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.480
He'll come back for sure.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.140
I think what you said is right.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.840
He'll definitely return.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.440
What's there to worry about?

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.920
Why are you

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.580
interested in them suddenly?

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.510
Because

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.040
I'm tired.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.670
Tired?

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.150
People only have one face,

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.240
but need

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.260
countless masks

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:32.380
to gain so-called freedom.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.280
Of course it's exhausting.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.150
I am not.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.110
Because you have masks.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.610
You came here today

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.710
because you're tired?

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:50.480
No.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.800
Liu Yan has arrived at Zhoudi Tower.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.800
Come.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.460
Come on.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.110
Come.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.880
You're here.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.960
I thought

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.580
you were dead.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.590
Didn't you say

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.480
I was trouble?

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.840
Trouble

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.320
doesn't die so easily.
