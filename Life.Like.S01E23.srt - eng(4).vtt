Hong!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.240
This...

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.600
What happened?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.640
Long story.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.120
Can you get us to safety?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.920
Quick.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.840
Come with me.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080
Be careful.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560
I'll go get her some clothes.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
You're burning up.

Sister...

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.200
Don't leave me.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.560
Boss.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.160
Ah.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160
From now on,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.200
you guys work for me.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.680
I promise you'll eat well
and live well.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080
Chairman Luo rules.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.880
You hear that?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.840
From now on,
we all follow Chairman Luo.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.440
Go and bring Zhou Musheng to me.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.000
There's a big reward.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.440
Of course, Chairman Luo.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.100
(Chairman of the North City
Chamber of Commerce assassinated.)

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.820
(North City Tailor)

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.480
Captain Luo.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.640
That's a lot of men.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.160
Did something happen?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.680
No.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.880
Oh, Captain Luo.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.280
What stunt are you trying to pull today?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.640
Hong.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.440
Zhou Musheng and Rose

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.640
are here with you, right?

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.600
Since my Rose met Zhou Musheng
from the North City Chamber,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.200
she hasn't held down
a single proper day of work.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.000
I never asked your Chamber for her.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.920
Captain Luo.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.840
And yet, you've come to
Night Shanghai to ask for her.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.160
Not to mention all the men

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.520
you've brought here.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.240
Zhou Musheng

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.360
killed the chairman of
North City Chamber of Commerce.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.640
Someone saw those two

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.160
hiding at Night Shanghai.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.280
Nonsense.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.000
Killing someone is a heinous crime.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.040
The police haven't even
come to question me.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.680
On what basis do you want to search me?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.790
Whether the police search here
is not my concern.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.440
But the one who died was our Chairman.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.880
This matter

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.760
must be handled.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.960
Captain Luo,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.200
are you trying
to shut Night Shanghai down?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.440
Night Shanghai hosts

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.120
prominent people from all over Shanghai.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.880
If you search here today,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.360
they'll search somewhere else.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.040
I'd become the joke of all Shanghai!

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.520
I am the captain
of the North City Chamber.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.360
If I can't catch the killer,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.960
then I'll be the joke of all Shanghai.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.840
You'd better hand the person over to me.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.080
Or else,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.080
I'll find them myself.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.680
Search thoroughly.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680
I dare you to move!

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.720
Do you think I'm scared?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.520
Pull the trigger, tough guy.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.280
Put the gun down.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.520
We received a tip.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.760
Someone at Night Shanghai

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.320
are causing trouble.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.600
Captain Luo,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.640
the troublemaker

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.950
wouldn't happen to be you, right?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.560
No.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.480
You should be called

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.680
Chairman Luo.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.520
Detective Cao.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.440
Call me whatever you like.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.800
Detective Cao,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.200
according to these men,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.480
Zhou Musheng

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.880
killed Chairman Du.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.640
Is that true?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.200
Whether it was Zhou Musheng or not,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.800
we'll only know after the investigation.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.720
Then, tell me this.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.400
Should I be cooperating
with your investigation, Detective Cao,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.640
or with Chairman Luo's investigation?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.280
Chairman Luo,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.760
what do you think?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.960
Detective Cao,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.680
since you're already here,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.480
there's no need
for me to investigate anymore.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.040
I'll leave it to you, Detective Cao.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.160
Catch Zhou Musheng as soon as possible

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.040
so the Chamber can have justice.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.280
Hong,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.840
we'll let you

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.720
get back to your business.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.360
Move out.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.640
Pack it up.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.280
Let's go.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.840
Thank you, Detective.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.320
Hong,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.360
a word, please.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.000
Is Zhou Musheng here with you?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.040
How could Zhou Musheng possibly be here?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.240
Hong,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.960
trust me.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.760
If Zhou Musheng is here,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.360
please take me to him.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.960
Musheng.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.320
I'm here.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.320
Well?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.120
Feeling better?

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.160
Yeah.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.160
Are you

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.040
feeling better now?

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.720
Yeah.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.440
Much better.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.200
Alright then.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.040
Carry on.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.400
I'll go keep watch outside.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.280
Thanks, Hong.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.760
Luo Zhenyao is hunting you
across the city now.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.640
He's pinned Du Hongyue's death on you.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.880
I know.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.720
Luo is completely
in cahoots with Yamamoto now.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.520
Yamamoto came here

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.040
for that shipment of medicine.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.240
They should make a move
in the next few days.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.400
This time,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.320
we have to take them all in one sweep.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.480
Detective Cao...

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.840
What are you two talking about?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320
He's doing his duty.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400
The North City Chamber

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
has secretly been smuggling arms

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.080
and medicine for the Japanese.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.960
I stayed in the Chamber

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.120
so that one day

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.880
I can bring them all down.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.600
So this is the little bit of light

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.120
you talked about.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.240
Yes.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.520
With the sliver of strength I have,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.080
I'll fight for that sliver of light.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.560
Count me in.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.280
