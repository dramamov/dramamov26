00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:50.661
You're making such a fuss.

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:53.664
You don't trust people,
so you even ask for a receipt.

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:57.701
Well, better safe than sorry.

00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:58.535
Thanks.

Did you take a day off work today?

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.608
That company's pretty lenient.

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:06.310
They even let rookies take days off.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.211
Well,

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:11.348
since I used to work there before,
they give me leeway.

00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:13.050
I'll go now.
Bye, ma'am.

Really?

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:25.095
Even when I offered to work unpaid first,
they said no?

00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.634
There's nothing we can do, then. Okay.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.037
Still, thank you for checking.

00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:35.105
Yes, bye.

Okay.

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:39.944
That's really harsh.

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.946

Why are you snooping on my phone?

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:27.625
Snooping? Why so defensive?

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.660
Are you texting your girlfriend or what?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.761
That's ridiculous.

00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:36.267

00:02:41.238 --> 00:02:42.806
Are there many applicants?

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:43.741
I don't know.

00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:48.879
You know,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.515
Should I try applying there once more?

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:52.750
What?

00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:55.920
The program's for women
returning after a career break.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.821
The age limit's 40,

00:02:57.821 --> 00:02:59.757
so if I apply now,
it's my last chance to...

00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:02.326
Why would you go there?
Who'd welcome you?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.302
I mean,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.307
have you already forgotten
how hard it was for you there?

00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:18.208
Why go back to that place?

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:20.244
That's exactly why I want to go back.

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:24.114
I left like I was running away.
I was embarrassed ever since.

00:03:24.114 --> 00:03:25.749
So isn't it natural...

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:26.884
to want to make up for it?

00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.086
And it's a great opportunity as well.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:34.525
I get how you feel,

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:35.859
but you'd better find another place.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.695
They barely even hire anyone.

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.811
I'm a 41-year-old office worker.

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:57.414
My boyfriend's five years younger than me
and we've dated for about three years.

00:03:57.414 --> 00:03:59.049
Our chemistry is amazing,

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.884
and our personalities really click.

00:04:00.884 --> 00:04:02.920
He's really someone I don't want to lose.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.823
So I started to think about marriage,

00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:08.259
but he's totally uninterested.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.461
He's a non-marriage type.

00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:12.162
I'm 41 now.

00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:14.231
Just dating with no thought of marriage...

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.033
makes me worried.

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.501
But if we break up,

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.870
I don't think I'd ever meet
someone like him again.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.740
What should I do?

00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:25.743
It's such a sad story.

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:27.678
Right. When a woman hits 40,

00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:29.980
she has complicated feelings.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.016
You think about marriage and childbirth.

00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:34.852
It's a time when a sense of crisis
starts to creep in.

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:53.837
Why aren't you texting?

00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:54.972
Are you that busy?

00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:57.474
What are you doing? Working?

00:04:58.442 --> 00:04:59.610
I'll call you later.

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:01.779
Aren't you even a little curious about me?

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:12.222
Honestly, it's not like I was dying
to get married.

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:15.192
But if he had proposed,
I wouldn't have said no, either.

00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:16.660
Still, this is just too much.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.861
Does he date me just to sleep with me?

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.067
(Photographer Eom)

00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:25.536
Hey.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:26.637
Are you busy?

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:28.138
No.

00:05:28.572 --> 00:05:31.175
Really? Then lend me your laptop.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:33.143
Mine keeps crashing for some reason.

00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:35.479
No.

00:05:35.913 --> 00:05:36.780
What's wrong?

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:38.349
Are you angry?

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.017
Wouldn't you be angry if it were you?

00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.520
After three weeks of no contact,
you call, and that's all you say?

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:46.991
Why are you treating me so badly?

00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:48.892
What did I do?

00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:50.527
It's not like we've just started dating.

00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:53.063
I just spoke casually because we're close.
Is that bad?

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:56.367
So,

00:05:57.468 --> 00:05:58.402
you won't lend me?

00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:01.138
Fine, then.

00:06:02.306 --> 00:06:03.240
Wait.

00:06:04.141 --> 00:06:04.875
Il Ri.

00:06:05.142 --> 00:06:06.043
Yeah?

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:08.279
Then bring me my Tom Brow cardigan too.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.180
The studio's kind of cold.

00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:39.276
Let's break up.

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.457
I'm still paying this off.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.767
No texts, no nothing.

00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:05.603
So you really want to break up?

00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:07.972
Okay, fine.
I have no regrets, either.

00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:15.913
What is it?

00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:18.048
What are you hiding?

00:07:18.682 --> 00:07:19.950
Nothing.

00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:24.922
Give it here.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.890
Now.

00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:40.271
Eom Jong Do.

00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:42.039
Let's break up.

00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:48.078
I'm still paying this off.

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:53.384
Where did you get this?

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:58.188
Why did they record a video
without my permission?

00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:00.157
Actually...

00:08:00.824 --> 00:08:01.659
Why?

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.827
What?

00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:07.264
Nothing.

00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:09.266
Right, the no-look pass.

00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:13.103
You looked cool!
What's the big deal?

00:08:13.103 --> 00:08:14.672
It's not like they filmed it on purpose.

00:08:15.739 --> 00:08:19.043
And you guys.

00:08:19.043 --> 00:08:20.377
Learn from her.

00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:22.546
The passion of a fashion editor...

00:08:22.546 --> 00:08:25.149
trying to secure
a limited-edition luxury item.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.819
Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:33.057
But Manager Eom called earlier.

00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:36.160
He was rambling.

00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:38.495
Maybe he's worried he'll get fired.

00:08:39.964 --> 00:08:41.799
Anyway, congratulations.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:44.735
Welcome back to the world
of infinite possibilities.

00:08:54.645 --> 00:08:55.713
Honestly,

00:08:56.614 --> 00:08:58.449
that guy was a total loser.

00:08:59.383 --> 00:09:00.918
He always wanted me to buy him things.

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:02.920
Once he asked...

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.623
for an Armani coat for Christmas.

00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:07.291
Guess what he got me?

00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:08.192
What?

00:09:08.192 --> 00:09:09.126
A game console.

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:10.361
Is that his or mine?

00:09:10.361 --> 00:09:11.996
His, not mine.

00:09:12.796 --> 00:09:14.365
Whenever we went to a fancy restaurant,

00:09:15.232 --> 00:09:16.667
he kept running to the bathroom...

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.103
until the meal was over.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.039
Who knows what he was doing there?

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.774
I'd wait forever but he wouldn't come.

00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:26.744
So I'd end up paying myself every time.

00:09:26.744 --> 00:09:28.145
Was I a walking wallet or what?

00:09:29.747 --> 00:09:32.049
Hey, at least have some snacks
while you drink.

00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:33.183
You'll ruin your stomach.

00:09:33.183 --> 00:09:34.385
How annoying.

00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:37.187
I'm so annoyed I can't even eat.

00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:39.056
My pride hurts.

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:42.326
I let a loser like that
drag me around for three years.

00:09:43.994 --> 00:09:45.696
I must've been insane.

00:09:45.696 --> 00:09:46.897
Totally insane.

00:09:47.364 --> 00:09:50.834
Lee Il Ri, you've finally
come to your senses.

00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:54.138
We told you so many times,
and you never listened.

00:09:54.138 --> 00:09:56.240
She said she couldn't give up
the "hot night."

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.841
"Hot night," my foot.

00:09:57.841 --> 00:09:59.910
Do you know what Mark Twain said?

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.745
He said the most insignificant thing...

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:04.415
humans mistake for important
are hot nights.

00:10:05.883 --> 00:10:06.784
Lee Il Ri.

00:10:06.984 --> 00:10:08.385
I actually think this is for the best.

00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:10.354
Honestly, what good did he do you?

00:10:10.354 --> 00:10:12.256
He used you like a wallet...

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:14.625
and wasn't even sweet about it.

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:15.726
- Exactly.
- Yes.

00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:16.860
But...

00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:20.664
you married people don't get it.

00:10:20.664 --> 00:10:21.665
What?

00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:24.201
Among all the guys I've dated,

00:10:24.201 --> 00:10:26.704
he was the best in bed.

00:10:26.704 --> 00:10:30.007
I'll never meet someone like that again.

00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:35.279
He was perfect in every way.

00:10:35.913 --> 00:10:38.082
- Had I known...
- What's wrong with her?

00:10:38.082 --> 00:10:39.917
I would've been in bed with him more.

00:10:40.784 --> 00:10:42.019
You guys have no idea...

00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:45.823
this feeling of loss I have.

00:10:45.823 --> 00:10:47.958
Just sleep.

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.960
What a mess.

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:52.663
Is that really something
to be that desperate about?

00:11:03.073 --> 00:11:04.708
How's your job search going?

00:11:05.376 --> 00:11:07.511
I got rejected from all of them.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:10.648
You know what everyone says to me?

00:11:10.648 --> 00:11:12.082
My résumé's too impressive.

00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:13.484
I'm too old.

00:11:13.484 --> 00:11:16.153
And even when I offered
to work for free, they still said no.

00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:17.388
My goodness. Really?

00:11:17.388 --> 00:11:18.389
Yes.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:20.991
Saying the market's flooded with
show hosts trying to build portfolios.

00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:25.162
My self-esteem's at rock bottom.

00:11:26.196 --> 00:11:27.197
Remember what I told you last time?

00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:30.734
I didn't want to look pathetic
in front of my landlady, Yang Mi Sook,

00:11:30.734 --> 00:11:33.470
so I lied and said I worked
at Sweet Home Shopping.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.105
So I tried applying somewhere...

00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:36.874
just to make that lie true.

00:11:37.508 --> 00:11:39.076
But now I feel like
I'm turning into a total fraud.

00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:44.248
But don't you want to go back
to Sweet Home Shopping?

00:11:45.983 --> 00:11:48.452
Who'd welcome me there?

00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:51.188
And honestly,

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:53.757
I'm scared I'll get rejected
and end up getting hurt again.

00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:56.293
You won't know until you try.

00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:57.428
You startled me.

00:11:57.428 --> 00:11:59.029
Why get scared before you even start?

00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:00.831
I thought you were sleeping.

00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:02.600
I woke up.

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:05.703
Hey.

00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:08.138
Just apply there.

00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:10.808
You said you got rejected
everywhere else anyway.

00:12:12.543 --> 00:12:14.979
Even if that's not the case,
I still think you should apply there.

00:12:15.813 --> 00:12:16.714
Why?

00:12:16.914 --> 00:12:18.148
They say a wounded heart only heals...

00:12:18.148 --> 00:12:19.817
when you face it head-on.

00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:22.853
I get that you want to avoid it,

00:12:23.354 --> 00:12:24.455
but since you've already
worked up the courage,

00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:26.457
charging forward might not be so bad.

00:12:27.925 --> 00:12:29.326
Hey, clean this up.

00:12:29.326 --> 00:12:31.762
Why are you taking it away?
I'm still eating.

00:12:31.762 --> 00:12:34.231
Come on, let's go already.
Stop drinking.

00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:36.100
Hey, where's the fish cake soup?
Bring it here.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.201
It's cold now.

00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:20.511
Hello, I'm...

00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:26.216
Hello.

00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:31.121
I'm Cho Na Jeong,
a former show host at Sweet Home Shopping.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.661
Hello.

00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:41.131
I'm Cho Na Jeong,
a former show host at Sweet Home Shopping.

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.104
When I was a working mom,

00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:49.506
I was as fragile as a leaf...

00:13:53.377 --> 00:13:55.813
When I was a working mom,

00:13:55.813 --> 00:13:59.049
I was as fragile as a leaf
that could crumble underfoot.

00:13:59.049 --> 00:14:01.952
Then later, as a full-time mom,

00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:05.422
I felt trapped in a murky,
stagnant reservoir.

00:14:05.422 --> 00:14:06.590
It felt endless.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.627
But those long, difficult times...

00:14:09.627 --> 00:14:12.162
became stepping stones for my growth.

00:14:15.866 --> 00:14:18.168
During six years of marriage,

00:14:18.636 --> 00:14:20.604
raising two children...

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:22.706
gave me countless feelings
and experiences to draw from...

00:14:26.944 --> 00:14:30.047
(Jungseok Full-Service Moving)

00:14:37.621 --> 00:14:38.789
Sorry.

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:06.850
How buff.

00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:08.319
Is he single?

00:15:17.528 --> 00:15:18.329
This is the place.

00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:20.230
Deluxe Hanmaeum Motel.

00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:22.566
Next to the chicken noodle soup place.

00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:27.071
(Deluxe Hanmaeum Motel)

00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:27.805
Okay.

00:15:30.307 --> 00:15:31.909
Like I said yesterday,

00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:33.477
lunch break's only an hour,

00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:34.845
so get there first and wait.

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:37.848
You won't be late this time, right?

00:15:37.848 --> 00:15:40.017
No way.
I even canceled my meetings.

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:43.053
Good.

00:15:43.988 --> 00:15:45.222
Try to get there early,

00:15:45.723 --> 00:15:46.991
and be ready.

00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:51.228
Manager Gu.

00:15:51.528 --> 00:15:52.663
Yes.

00:15:54.865 --> 00:15:57.401
For next April's
Back to the Classic showcase,

00:15:57.401 --> 00:15:59.203
we've shortlisted "Macbeth"
by Yeonhu Theater Company...

00:15:59.203 --> 00:16:01.338
and "Waiting for Godot"...

00:16:01.338 --> 00:16:02.840
by the acting troupe Butterfly Dance.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.375
For the May Spring Night Music Festival,

00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.176
how about we push forward
a collaboration...

00:16:06.176 --> 00:16:09.780
between the Insan Symphony Orchestra
and pianist Kim Ja Young?

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.814
Kim Ja Young?

00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:15.052
She's too young and unproven, isn't she?

00:16:15.052 --> 00:16:18.155
Sir, Ja Young is ridiculous.

00:16:18.155 --> 00:16:21.125
I've reviewed recent pianist profiles.

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:23.360
She's one of the strongest contenders...

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.529
for this year's Chopin Competition.

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:26.397
That's impressive.
Why not?

00:16:27.197 --> 00:16:30.634
Manager Shin,
you could learn a thing or two from her.

00:16:30.634 --> 00:16:32.269
Manager Gu's always thinking
several moves ahead.

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:36.507
All right then,
prepare the festival like that.

00:16:37.841 --> 00:16:38.676
What about the plays?

00:16:39.209 --> 00:16:41.612
As for "Macbeth" and "Waiting for Godot,"

00:16:41.612 --> 00:16:43.881
since both have strong name recognition,

00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:45.950
we can expect high ticket sales.

00:16:52.289 --> 00:16:53.257
That scared me.

00:16:58.362 --> 00:17:00.864
Manager Gu, where shall we go for lunch?

00:17:00.864 --> 00:17:03.867
Sorry, you all go ahead.

00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:05.069
I already have plans.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.970
Okay.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.307
We're such unimportant people.

00:17:10.307 --> 00:17:11.475
Don't even bother asking her.

00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:16.213
Now that I think about it,
she skipped the last company dinner too.

00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:20.117
These days, she's even picky about
which company dinner she joins.

00:17:22.052 --> 00:17:24.054
I've got a long way to go to be like her.

00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:25.756
A long, long way.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.658
That's what working life's about, right?

00:17:29.426 --> 00:17:31.295
Manager Shin, why are you so interested...

00:17:31.295 --> 00:17:33.430
in my whereabouts
that no one else even remembers?

00:17:34.498 --> 00:17:36.433
Anyone would think you're stalking me.

00:17:36.967 --> 00:17:37.801
Excuse me?

00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:42.506
Yes?

00:17:43.741 --> 00:17:44.808
Chicken noodle soup?

00:17:47.444 --> 00:17:48.412
Yes, that sounds great.

00:17:49.647 --> 00:17:50.514
Where?

00:17:51.682 --> 00:17:53.284
Right next to Hanmaeum Motel?

00:17:54.118 --> 00:17:55.486
Okay, got it.

00:17:56.253 --> 00:17:57.121
Yes.

00:18:01.725 --> 00:18:02.960
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.761
I'm starving.

00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:13.604
Didn't you say
there's another good restaurant nearby?

00:18:13.604 --> 00:18:15.506
Yes, a new one opened just behind here.

00:18:15.506 --> 00:18:16.674
- Where?
- Over there.

00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:19.276
That looks good.

00:18:19.877 --> 00:18:21.712
- Let's go there tomorrow.
- Great.

(OS25)

00:19:46.797 --> 00:19:47.798
Is it raining outside?

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.834
No, it's sunny.

00:19:52.836 --> 00:19:53.704
Exactly.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.278
- Excuse me.
- Do you need a room?

00:20:02.046 --> 00:20:03.581
Someone's waiting for me upstairs.

00:20:07.918 --> 00:20:10.354
Hey, which room is it?

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:12.456
Tell me now.

00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:13.223
Well,

00:20:13.824 --> 00:20:14.825
you see, honey,

00:20:15.326 --> 00:20:18.228
I suddenly got indigestion.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.365
You bastard!

00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:50.961
Yes, sir.

00:20:51.462 --> 00:20:53.530
I tried to delay it somehow,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.366
but it looks like
I'll have to do it next year.

00:21:09.113 --> 00:21:10.414
Sir, I'll call you back in a bit.

00:21:11.982 --> 00:21:13.918

- Yes.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.402
Wait.

00:21:31.902 --> 00:21:34.638
So what happened to Ms. Cho?

00:21:34.638 --> 00:21:35.439
What about her?

00:21:36.407 --> 00:21:38.108
She applied for the experienced position.

00:21:38.309 --> 00:21:39.176
What did you say?

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.992
(Sweet Home Shopping

Why didn't you tell me
you applied to Sweet Home Shopping?

00:22:13.477 --> 00:22:16.313
I was going to tell you if I got in.

00:22:16.847 --> 00:22:18.382
But honey, I...

00:22:18.382 --> 00:22:20.150
You should've told me first.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.219
Why do I have to hear it at work?

00:22:22.553 --> 00:22:25.055
And I told you to apply somewhere else,
not Sweet Home Shopping.

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:27.524
Why exactly can't I apply there?

00:22:27.524 --> 00:22:29.560
And what, if you say, "Don't do it,"

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.228
am I just supposed to say
"Yes, sir" and listen?

00:22:32.763 --> 00:22:34.798
What I'm saying is,

00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:38.535
do you really have to start
working right now?

since Min Woo's skin condition got better?

a year or two for your kid?

I'm sorry, honey.

00:23:16.974 --> 00:23:18.776
I was just about to leave earlier,

00:23:20.477 --> 00:23:23.314

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:27.651
If I'd gone,
I wouldn't have managed anyway.

00:23:57.581 --> 00:23:58.749
we should just stop trying for a baby.

Honestly,

00:24:03.988 --> 00:24:05.189
because of my age,

00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:08.359
and because our parents keep waiting,

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:10.261
I kept trying.

00:24:11.595 --> 00:24:13.597
But if it's this hard for you,
we can stop.

00:24:19.003 --> 00:24:20.871
Fine. Then stop.

00:24:21.805 --> 00:24:22.706
But...

00:24:24.642 --> 00:24:26.343
then are we going to live
like this forever?

00:24:27.912 --> 00:24:29.847
The reason I wanted to have a baby...

00:24:30.781 --> 00:24:33.951
wasn't only for the baby.
I thought it'd bring us closer too.

00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:36.487
So what I want to know is this.

00:24:37.321 --> 00:24:38.722
Do you not find me attractive anymore?

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.994
No, it's not that.

00:24:44.828 --> 00:24:46.497
Then what is it?

00:24:46.997 --> 00:24:48.265
Tell me.

00:24:53.437 --> 00:24:56.473
Sorry, but I need to wash up.

00:24:57.341 --> 00:25:00.210
I still feel nauseous.
I need to lie down.

00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:22.900
So what,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.201
are you saying I'm selfish?

00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:28.272
Am I a failure as a mother?

00:25:28.839 --> 00:25:31.041
Because the kids are still young
and need me,

00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:32.409
but I keep wanting to work?

00:25:32.409 --> 00:25:33.711
Who said that?

00:25:34.545 --> 00:25:35.546
But you know what?

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.881
I'm 41 now.

00:25:38.148 --> 00:25:40.784
Even by international age,
it's an undeniable 40.

00:25:40.784 --> 00:25:42.419
In a year or two,
even if I want to join somewhere,

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:43.454
I absolutely won't be able to.

00:25:43.654 --> 00:25:44.955
"You're his mom, and you can't wait?"

00:25:45.689 --> 00:25:47.291
How could you say that to me?

00:25:47.858 --> 00:25:49.493
You know exactly how I've been living.

00:25:49.493 --> 00:25:51.195
How can you say something like that?

00:25:51.428 --> 00:25:53.430
For the six years since I married you,

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.100
I practically lived in hospitals and ERs.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.269
I made our soap and detergent
with my own hands.

00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:59.670
That's enough.

00:26:00.838 --> 00:26:03.507
I studied just like you did,

00:26:03.507 --> 00:26:05.175
and I held down a normal job.

00:26:05.175 --> 00:26:06.810
But ever since we got married,

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.245
I'm the only one stuck in place.

00:26:08.245 --> 00:26:10.915
Everyone else keeps running ahead,
and I'm the only one standing still.

00:26:12.116 --> 00:26:15.219
Do you know how miserable it feels
to fall behind day by day?

00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:17.121
Do you think anyone goes to work
because they love it?

00:26:18.822 --> 00:26:21.191
Everyone lives like that.

00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:22.793
Fine.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.163
For you, work might be
a fancy self-fulfillment.

00:26:26.897 --> 00:26:29.099
But for me, work is the livelihood
of our family of four.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.069
And you think
we're worrying on the same level?

00:26:37.675 --> 00:26:39.343
Is this who you really are?

00:26:39.677 --> 00:26:41.779
I'm telling you this is reality.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.265
Hello, ma'am.

00:27:01.265 --> 00:27:03.267
- Listen to your teacher.
- Go on in.

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:05.069
See you this evening.

00:27:05.069 --> 00:27:05.970
Go in.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.037
Thank you.

00:27:07.037 --> 00:27:08.906
- Min Woo, Min Jun, hi.
- Hello.

00:27:08.906 --> 00:27:09.873
Hello.

00:27:11.442 --> 00:27:13.043
Have fun, my little princes.

00:27:13.477 --> 00:27:14.845
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:23.520
(A parent observation class will be held.)

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.855
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.)

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:30.327
(Sweet Home Shopping
2nd-round Interview Notice)

00:27:30.327 --> 00:27:31.495
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.)

00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:35.099
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.)

00:27:35.666 --> 00:27:39.536
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.
Please arrive 20 minutes early.)

00:27:45.709 --> 00:27:47.111
Gorgeous.

00:27:47.111 --> 00:27:47.845
Yes, that's good.

00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:50.414
Cute. Nice.

00:27:51.382 --> 00:27:52.149
Good.

00:27:53.217 --> 00:27:54.118
Beautiful.

00:27:54.118 --> 00:27:55.119
Nice.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.421
Look at the flower. Nice.

00:27:57.888 --> 00:27:58.989
Cute.

00:27:59.957 --> 00:28:01.825
Nice, very nice.

00:28:03.093 --> 00:28:04.028
Show me sexy.

00:28:05.896 --> 00:28:07.898
That's sexy.

00:28:09.733 --> 00:28:11.168
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:14.171
I can't even.

00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:17.374
What CEO asks to run her own pictorial
in her own magazine?

00:28:18.242 --> 00:28:19.410
Well, what can we do?

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.513
If we want our paycheck,
we just have to grovel.

00:28:22.513 --> 00:28:24.181
Okay. All right, good.

00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:28.652
Okay, let's keep going.

00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:32.790
You two still haven't made up?

00:28:33.657 --> 00:28:35.359
What are you talking about?
We're over.

00:28:36.193 --> 00:28:38.195
Come on.
Judging by Manager Eom today,

00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:41.231
he looks like he wants you
to start a conversation.

00:28:41.231 --> 00:28:44.068
Exactly.
He keeps sneaking glances even now.

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:46.203
Okay, just a little more.

00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:49.206
Come on.

00:28:49.206 --> 00:28:51.342
You go first and break the ice.

00:28:51.342 --> 00:28:53.677
In times like this, the dumper
should be the one to approach first.

00:28:54.311 --> 00:28:55.412
- Go!
- Go!

00:28:55.412 --> 00:28:57.047
Go!

00:28:57.047 --> 00:28:59.049
- We'll...
- Leave!

00:29:07.358 --> 00:29:08.926
- We'll check and continue.
- Okay.

00:29:28.812 --> 00:29:30.314
Isn't it gorgeous?

00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:33.083
Manager, what filter did you use here?

00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:34.652
It's a new filter that just came out.

00:29:34.652 --> 00:29:35.853
Let's keep it between us.

00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:37.755
- Shush.
- Yes.

00:29:38.722 --> 00:29:40.658
Good, very good.

00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:42.593
I'm going to post this
right away after this,

00:29:42.593 --> 00:29:44.595
so while I'm being interviewed,
can you write the caption?

00:29:44.595 --> 00:29:46.363
Okay.

00:29:54.138 --> 00:29:55.005
What?

00:29:56.307 --> 00:29:57.808
What is this?

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.945
Is this...

00:30:01.545 --> 00:30:02.746
Is this really me?

00:30:03.113 --> 00:30:03.981
My gosh.

00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:06.817
I don't look like this.

00:30:07.918 --> 00:30:09.186
Why do I look so fat?

00:30:11.221 --> 00:30:13.457
What the.

00:30:13.457 --> 00:30:15.593
Why would you shoot the photo like this?

00:30:15.593 --> 00:30:16.794
Are you serious?

00:30:18.262 --> 00:30:20.364
- Manager, bring me your phone.
- Yes?

00:30:22.032 --> 00:30:22.833
Here.

00:30:23.701 --> 00:30:24.969
Look at this.

00:30:24.969 --> 00:30:25.970
Beautiful.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.504
This one looks so pretty,

00:30:28.706 --> 00:30:31.241
so why do I look so wide here?

00:30:32.009 --> 00:30:33.978
That one has a filter on it.

00:30:33.978 --> 00:30:35.145
No.

00:30:35.145 --> 00:30:37.414
It only tweaked the color.
The photo's the same.

00:30:43.487 --> 00:30:44.521
Manager, what is this?

00:30:45.489 --> 00:30:47.758
You're way worse at taking photos
than my manager.

00:30:49.326 --> 00:30:51.729
This one's prettier.
What are you talking about?

00:30:51.729 --> 00:30:53.130
And photos that go to print...

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.566
look tacky if you retouch them like that.

00:31:02.373 --> 00:31:03.274
True.

00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:04.575
Yes.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:05.943
That wouldn't work.

00:31:06.877 --> 00:31:09.446
Deputy Editor,
you sound pretty professional today.

00:31:11.615 --> 00:31:12.549
I like it.

00:31:19.924 --> 00:31:21.292
Do it like this.

00:31:21.292 --> 00:31:22.826
And like this.

00:31:23.327 --> 00:31:24.795
Hey, what are you doing?

00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:28.198
Like this.

00:31:28.198 --> 00:31:29.900
No, if you do it like this...

00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:31.869
That's it.

00:31:34.238 --> 00:31:35.372
Mom, for you.

00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:38.509
Thanks.

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:39.944
Mom, for you.

00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:41.312
Thanks.

00:31:44.949 --> 00:31:46.951
Okay, thanks.

00:31:51.021 --> 00:31:52.523
Let's make a cat.

00:31:52.523 --> 00:31:53.257
Okay.

00:31:57.194 --> 00:31:58.262
Okay, last one.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.365
Great work.

00:32:04.134 --> 00:32:06.103
Good job.

00:32:07.605 --> 00:32:08.539
Thank you for your work.

00:32:17.114 --> 00:32:18.048
Good job today.

00:32:22.253 --> 00:32:23.787
- Thank you.
- Nice work.

00:32:23.787 --> 00:32:25.055
Are you posting a Reels after this too?

00:32:25.055 --> 00:32:26.323
How did you know?

00:32:29.126 --> 00:32:30.494
I'm heading out.
See you tomorrow.

00:32:30.494 --> 00:32:31.795
See you tomorrow.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:33.998
What?

00:32:33.998 --> 00:32:36.400
Being childish and overacting
on purpose so I see it?

00:32:59.657 --> 00:33:00.557
Hey.

00:33:01.392 --> 00:33:02.860
You're dragging it out this time.

00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:06.864
So what?
You want to end it like this?

00:33:10.034 --> 00:33:11.402
You sure can hold a grudge.

00:33:12.369 --> 00:33:14.605
Fine. I'm sorry.

00:33:14.805 --> 00:33:17.675
But you need to stop ignoring texts too.

00:33:17.675 --> 00:33:19.877
Do you know how much
that pisses me off?

00:33:21.078 --> 00:33:22.546
Il Ri, let's not be like this.

00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:29.687
We said we'd be cool
no matter how or when it ends.

00:33:30.187 --> 00:33:31.288
No clinging.

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:19.236
Everyone.

00:34:19.236 --> 00:34:22.306
Are you just going to brush
three times a day the usual way?

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:25.643
A micro-bristle toothbrush
that also cares for your gums.

00:34:25.643 --> 00:34:28.012
It's no longer optional, but essential.

00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:30.447
Micro-bristle toothbrush.

00:34:31.048 --> 00:34:33.417
Micro-bristle toothbrush.

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:36.820
Is there a styling you want?

00:34:37.588 --> 00:34:38.789
If you roll it like this,

00:34:38.789 --> 00:34:41.892
you can handle any styling you like.

00:34:47.131 --> 00:34:48.432
Mom, what are you doing?

00:34:49.133 --> 00:34:49.934
Well...

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.075
Hello, everyone.

00:34:58.075 --> 00:34:59.743
The product I'm introducing today...

00:35:00.577 --> 00:35:02.513
is this little one.

00:35:03.113 --> 00:35:06.016
For those with severe inner dryness,

00:35:06.016 --> 00:35:07.284
I strongly recommend this.

00:35:15.192 --> 00:35:17.061
For tomorrow's open class,

00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:18.662
should we at least bring snacks?

00:35:18.662 --> 00:35:21.532
It's our kids' first open class this year.

00:35:21.532 --> 00:35:23.133
How about simple snacks?

00:35:24.368 --> 00:35:26.503
Is there anything special
we should prepare?

00:35:26.503 --> 00:35:27.771
It's my first time, so I don't know.

00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:29.873
I'm so excited to see our kids sing.

00:35:33.777 --> 00:35:36.547
I have an interview tomorrow at 11...

00:35:36.547 --> 00:35:41.318
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Kindergarten)

00:36:09.313 --> 00:36:10.447
Aren't you getting on?

00:36:10.447 --> 00:36:11.448
You go ahead.

00:36:41.145 --> 00:36:42.179
Yes, ma'am?

00:36:43.547 --> 00:36:44.348
What?

00:36:51.789 --> 00:36:54.058
He suddenly threw up after a snack,

00:36:54.058 --> 00:36:56.327
and he was burning up with a fever.

00:36:56.327 --> 00:36:59.597
A lot of kids haven't been coming
because of the flu lately,

00:36:59.597 --> 00:37:01.332
and I think Min Woo caught it too.

00:37:01.332 --> 00:37:03.067
Mom, why are you crying?

00:37:03.867 --> 00:37:06.103
Are you upset I couldn't sing?

00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:08.405
No.

00:37:09.707 --> 00:37:11.575
I'm upset because you're sick, Min Woo.

00:37:12.476 --> 00:37:13.811
Sorry, Mom.

00:37:15.913 --> 00:37:17.081
No, it's okay.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.424
(Bambino Pediatrics)

00:38:16.674 --> 00:38:18.275
Don't be too discouraged.

00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:21.579
You never know when and how
another opportunity will come.

00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:23.480
If you wait a little,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.416
a much better position
might open up, right?

00:38:27.484 --> 00:38:28.719
I'm not sure.

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:31.121
Maybe I'm fated to live and die like this.

00:38:31.822 --> 00:38:33.490
Are you going to drink that go wild again?

00:38:35.326 --> 00:38:36.760
I can't sleep at all these days.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.530
If I drink this, maybe I can sleep.

00:38:41.532 --> 00:38:43.267
No need to watch
my figure anymore, anyway.

00:38:48.505 --> 00:38:52.109
But why was your husband
so strongly against it?

00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:53.277
Exactly.

00:38:53.277 --> 00:38:55.212
I mean, sure, he can disagree.

00:38:55.212 --> 00:38:56.847
But it went beyond that.

00:38:56.847 --> 00:38:58.582
He snapped.

00:38:58.582 --> 00:39:00.117
How annoying.

00:39:00.117 --> 00:39:01.552
I don't even want to talk to him.

00:39:01.552 --> 00:39:03.454
That's how they all are.

00:39:03.454 --> 00:39:05.256
They tell you, "Go ahead and work."

00:39:05.256 --> 00:39:06.557
But the moment their wife actually does,

00:39:06.557 --> 00:39:08.359
"Work, but you take care of the kid."

00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:09.293
They're always like this.

00:39:09.893 --> 00:39:11.262
They want a double income,

00:39:11.695 --> 00:39:13.197
but they hate sharing housework.

00:39:13.731 --> 00:39:15.366
Was your husband like that too?

00:39:15.366 --> 00:39:16.467
Totally.

00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:19.803
When I went back to work
three months after my first baby,

00:39:21.038 --> 00:39:23.173
he didn't even do anything at home.

00:39:23.173 --> 00:39:24.308
My goodness.

00:39:24.308 --> 00:39:25.709
Thinking back now,

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.045
I should've gotten a divorce then.

00:39:28.345 --> 00:39:30.848
So how did you end up
having the youngest after that?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.285
Right away?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.123
- You're unbelievable.
- Darn it.

00:39:39.123 --> 00:39:42.359
These days, I don't know why
I keep spilling everything I eat.

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:44.194
My goodness.

00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:45.396
- Did you wipe it all?
- Yes.

00:39:46.163 --> 00:39:48.132
Right, didn't you say
you had a discount coupon?

00:39:48.132 --> 00:39:49.166
I have one.

00:39:55.072 --> 00:39:57.441
Wait, what?

00:39:57.908 --> 00:39:58.776
Why?

00:39:59.043 --> 00:40:00.978
The second interview...

00:40:01.512 --> 00:40:02.780
got postponed.

00:40:03.681 --> 00:40:04.915
What do you mean?

00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:07.484
Apparently, the executives
had an emergency meeting,

00:40:08.218 --> 00:40:10.421
and they moved the interview date.

00:40:10.921 --> 00:40:11.889
Really?

00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:12.990
Then when is it?

00:40:15.092 --> 00:40:17.127
Today, at two.

00:40:17.728 --> 00:40:19.229
Today at two?

00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:24.335
Hey, it's fine.

00:40:24.335 --> 00:40:26.036
You still have an hour.
You'll make it.

00:40:27.438 --> 00:40:29.940
But what do we do with that stain?

00:40:34.712 --> 00:40:37.348
What do you mean, "What do we do?"
I can't go, that's what.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.957
Hey.

Hey, stop eating.

00:40:54.632 --> 00:40:56.433
Stop. You have to go now.

00:40:56.433 --> 00:40:58.035
You only have an hour left.
Let's go now.

00:40:58.035 --> 00:40:58.802
Come on.

00:40:58.802 --> 00:41:01.739
I'll watch the kids.

00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:04.742
Just go already.
What are you doing?

00:41:04.742 --> 00:41:07.244
What are you planning to do?

00:41:07.244 --> 00:41:09.513
Hey, your face...

00:41:09.513 --> 00:41:10.314
What's wrong with you, Cho Na Jeong?

00:41:10.314 --> 00:41:13.450
Snap out of it, Cho Na Jeong.

00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:17.021
Hey, Cho Na Jeong!

00:41:18.822 --> 00:41:19.456
Hey.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.125
Take off your clothes.

Na Jeong.

00:41:25.029 --> 00:41:26.230
Cho Na Jeong!

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.399
Hey, take this.

00:41:28.399 --> 00:41:30.000
There's makeup and my wallet.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.101
Thank you.

00:41:31.101 --> 00:41:32.303
You got this. Go now.

00:41:33.837 --> 00:41:35.639
Cho Na Jeong, good luck.

00:41:50.187 --> 00:41:52.189
I have no choice.
I'll just call it a concept.

(5th Floor Conference Room

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:13.911

00:42:15.579 --> 00:42:16.313
Hey.

00:42:17.514 --> 00:42:18.382
Ye Na.

00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:23.954
You applied here too?

00:42:23.954 --> 00:42:24.989
Well,

00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:27.591
that's what happened.

00:42:29.026 --> 00:42:30.127
But...

00:42:30.995 --> 00:42:32.496
your outfit's a bit...

00:42:33.564 --> 00:42:34.632
Actually,

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:38.902
remember my friend
who's a deputy editor at N Life Magazine?

00:42:38.902 --> 00:42:42.139
She said the color trend
for next year's S/S season...

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:44.008
are purple and green,

00:42:44.008 --> 00:42:46.543
so I went bold with those two.

00:42:46.543 --> 00:42:48.012
Maybe too bold.

00:42:48.012 --> 00:42:49.179
I'm always ahead of the curve.

00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:51.949
But the competition's so fierce.

00:42:52.516 --> 00:42:54.318

Apparently, all sorts showed up.

By the way,

00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.429

They say she made a ton of money
doing live commerce streams.

00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:21.579
Even someone like that
came to take our spots.

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:22.580
Why doesn't she just stick
to her own platform?

You lied like no one would ever find out.

00:43:39.797 --> 00:43:42.766
What, you hated working with me that much?

No, it's not like that.

00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:48.572
But what about you?

00:43:48.906 --> 00:43:50.040
Why are you here?

00:43:50.307 --> 00:43:51.642
You said you're a famous show host.

00:43:55.012 --> 00:43:58.449
Well, that's the minor league,
and this is the majors.

00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:00.517
I'm too good to stay stuck...

00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:02.653

Hello! I love your broadcasts.

Can I shake your hand?

Thanks.

- You too, Na Jeong.
- Thanks.

00:44:37.354 --> 00:44:39.690
Your kid's burning up with a fever.

You didn't know?

00:44:41.392 --> 00:44:43.360
But he was fine this morning.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.561
How high is it?

00:44:44.561 --> 00:44:46.997
Over 39 degrees.

00:44:47.765 --> 00:44:49.900
He's shivering all over.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.103
If he has a seizure, it could be serious.

00:44:53.871 --> 00:44:56.006
Could you please come back, even now?

00:44:56.006 --> 00:44:57.274
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

00:44:57.274 --> 00:44:59.143
- I'll call you again.
- I'm just so scared.

You act like this,

nobody wants to work with moms.

I'm sorry.

Yes, that's right.

within my own channel alone.

and tap into the rapidly growing
live commerce market,

00:48:18.242 --> 00:48:20.277
I applied to Sweet Home Shopping.

00:48:21.545 --> 00:48:22.446
You're not just switching over...

00:48:22.446 --> 00:48:24.281
because live commerce
got too hard, are you?

00:48:25.816 --> 00:48:27.585
I've heard personal stream sales...

00:48:27.585 --> 00:48:29.053
are just shiny on the outside.

00:48:29.653 --> 00:48:31.889
Of course, it's not easy.

00:48:31.889 --> 00:48:32.723
But...

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.526
I survived in that tough market.

00:48:36.293 --> 00:48:39.096
I've done five-hour live streams
with 1,000 concurrent viewers,

00:48:39.096 --> 00:48:42.266
and sold more than 1,000 items
in a single session.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.168
In terms of skill and experience,

00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:46.270
I don't think I'm behind anyone.

00:48:49.106 --> 00:48:51.709
But both of you have kids, right?

00:48:51.709 --> 00:48:52.710
Who looks after them?

00:48:53.377 --> 00:48:55.179
We often have early-morning broadcasts,

00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:56.580
and unpredictable hours.

00:48:59.216 --> 00:49:00.017
I...

00:49:00.884 --> 00:49:03.387
have a live-in caregiver, so it's fine.

00:49:07.258 --> 00:49:09.293
Your kids don't cause trouble
these days, right?

00:49:11.462 --> 00:49:12.263
Yes.

00:49:12.997 --> 00:49:14.632
I apologize again about that incident.

00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:17.968
Then let's get right to it.

00:49:19.837 --> 00:49:21.805
You all know how this test works, right?

00:49:21.805 --> 00:49:23.140
It's a blind test.

00:49:23.807 --> 00:49:25.409
You'll see a product appear
on the screen behind you,

00:49:25.409 --> 00:49:27.645
and you'll sell it
as if you're on a live broadcast.

00:49:27.645 --> 00:49:28.579
If...

00:49:30.414 --> 00:49:32.049
I decide to buy the product,

00:49:32.049 --> 00:49:35.653
that person automatically
passes this round.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.860
(Sweet Hotel Stay Package
700 dollars)

00:49:48.732 --> 00:49:52.036
(Sweet Hotel Stay Package
700 dollars)

00:50:04.348 --> 00:50:05.783
Hello, everyone.

00:50:05.783 --> 00:50:07.251
Today we've prepared for you...

00:50:07.251 --> 00:50:10.354
a one-night stay at the Sweet Hotel
with a limousine ride,

00:50:10.354 --> 00:50:13.991
plus tickets to the famous
Sweet Hotel show.

00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:17.194
A package never before seen
in home shopping history.

00:50:17.194 --> 00:50:19.663
I can already feel the customers' eyes...

00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:21.565
widening with excitement.

00:50:21.565 --> 00:50:24.868
From Hunan, China, user "I'llTakeThis"...

00:50:24.868 --> 00:50:26.971
has shared that they're planning a trip
to Korea early next year...

00:50:26.971 --> 00:50:28.806
and already expressed interest
in buying this product.

00:50:28.806 --> 00:50:29.807
That's right.

00:50:29.807 --> 00:50:32.142
If you miss this timing,
this price, this package,

00:50:32.142 --> 00:50:33.911
the cost will go up.

00:50:33.911 --> 00:50:35.379
I hope you all can take advantage...

00:50:35.379 --> 00:50:37.715
of this deal while the broadcast lasts.

00:50:37.715 --> 00:50:39.550
And we've also prepared...

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.852
a special giveaway.

00:50:41.852 --> 00:50:43.921
A truly incredible giveaway.

00:50:43.921 --> 00:50:47.358
A dinner at the Sweet Hotel restaurant.

00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:56.533
Na Jeong, why leave a child...

00:50:56.967 --> 00:50:58.168
unattended at a restaurant?

00:51:01.805 --> 00:51:05.109
For you, work might be
a fancy self-fulfillment.

00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:06.977
But for me, work is the livelihood
of our family of four.

00:51:07.745 --> 00:51:09.079
Why would you go back there?

00:51:09.079 --> 00:51:10.581
Who'd welcome you?

00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:11.582
Ms. Cho Na Jeong.

00:51:23.894 --> 00:51:24.762
Everyone.

00:51:25.496 --> 00:51:26.997
How many times...

00:51:26.997 --> 00:51:30.067
in your life have you ridden in a car...

00:51:30.067 --> 00:51:31.468
where someone
politely opened the door for you?

00:51:33.003 --> 00:51:36.740
Realistically,
unless we're a president or a minister,

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.209
it's rare to have someone...

00:51:39.209 --> 00:51:41.078
open a car door for us.

00:51:41.078 --> 00:51:42.513
Maybe it'll never happen in your lifetime.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.015
But does that mean...

00:51:45.382 --> 00:51:48.419
we don't deserve to be treated like VIPs?

00:51:49.386 --> 00:51:50.254
Of course not.

00:51:50.821 --> 00:51:53.023
Think of your parents.

00:51:54.525 --> 00:51:56.827
Your father who works hard...

00:51:57.094 --> 00:51:59.096
from dawn until late at night,

00:52:00.097 --> 00:52:01.932
and your mother...

00:52:01.932 --> 00:52:04.201
who cares for you day and night, 24/7.

00:52:04.969 --> 00:52:06.737
We all feel it, don't we?

00:52:07.438 --> 00:52:08.939
That lump in our throats...

00:52:10.007 --> 00:52:12.543
just thinking of our parents.

00:52:13.477 --> 00:52:14.478
Then,

00:52:14.845 --> 00:52:17.081
have you ever...

00:52:17.081 --> 00:52:20.351
opened a car door for your parents?

00:52:24.755 --> 00:52:27.524
My father was a welder.

00:52:41.372 --> 00:52:42.473
Na Jeong.

00:52:44.742 --> 00:52:45.743
Hey, Na Jeong.

00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:49.179
Hey, why did you just walk away
when I called you?

00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:51.415
Just.

00:52:51.615 --> 00:52:55.019
Because he was the one person
who truly believed in and understood me,

00:52:55.019 --> 00:52:57.688
I still miss him so much.

00:52:58.389 --> 00:53:01.392
He worked long, hard hours
from dawn until night.

00:53:02.426 --> 00:53:04.595
And he passed away
in an unexpected accident...

00:53:04.895 --> 00:53:07.164
at the work site when I was 13.

00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:09.500
So,

00:53:10.234 --> 00:53:12.369
if my father were still alive today,

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.505
I'd want to tell him...

00:53:15.639 --> 00:53:18.375
thank you,

00:53:18.809 --> 00:53:20.411
and that he made me really happy.

00:53:21.712 --> 00:53:22.680
But now,

00:53:23.314 --> 00:53:24.715
it's too late.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.487
Dear customers,

00:53:31.622 --> 00:53:34.358
if I could take my father
on this limousine ride,

00:53:35.459 --> 00:53:37.695
I wouldn't hesitate to pay
not 700 dollars,

00:53:38.629 --> 00:53:42.266
but 7,000 or even 70,000 dollars.

00:53:43.867 --> 00:53:45.803
Of course, the hotel stay is great,

00:53:45.803 --> 00:53:47.605
and the show tickets are wonderful too.

00:53:48.639 --> 00:53:52.209
But what about gifting your parents...

00:53:52.209 --> 00:53:54.211
this one precious minute...

00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:56.714
of riding in a limousine...

00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:01.018
from the hotel to the show?

00:54:10.728 --> 00:54:11.762
Ms. Yang Mi Sook.

00:54:12.763 --> 00:54:13.631
Yes?

00:54:15.566 --> 00:54:16.533
Seven hundred dollars.

00:54:17.968 --> 00:54:20.037
Paying all that at once is a bit heavy.

00:54:20.037 --> 00:54:21.272
Are there installment options?

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.309
What's great about home shopping,
dear customer?

00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:27.278
Of course,
it's interest-free for 24 months,

00:54:27.278 --> 00:54:30.014
and you can pay
about 29 dollars a month...

00:54:30.014 --> 00:54:32.883
to get this product easily and economically.

00:54:34.518 --> 00:54:36.220
Ms. Yang, you're quick on the math...

00:54:36.887 --> 00:54:38.389
and great at thinking on your feet.

00:54:41.458 --> 00:54:42.393
But...

00:54:42.593 --> 00:54:44.929
when it comes to storytelling,
Ms. Cho has got the edge.

00:54:46.597 --> 00:54:47.665
One minute from both of you.

00:54:48.766 --> 00:54:49.667
I'll...

00:54:51.402 --> 00:54:52.336
buy them all.

00:55:15.392 --> 00:55:16.560
Hey, Jjon Na Jeong.

00:55:17.094 --> 00:55:20.130
Did you talk about your parents
to pull a tear-jerking stunt?

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.466
You're just as annoying as ever.

00:55:22.466 --> 00:55:24.101
What did you just say?

00:55:28.973 --> 00:55:30.207
See you again, my friend.

00:55:30.407 --> 00:55:31.241
Bye.

00:55:33.544 --> 00:55:34.278
Cho Na Jeong.

00:55:35.312 --> 00:55:36.714
You haven't lost your touch.

00:55:37.448 --> 00:55:38.649
Thank you, Executive Director.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:40.851
Emotional marketing, I see.

00:55:45.022 --> 00:55:45.923
But you.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:48.759
Even if you've gained weight,

00:55:49.526 --> 00:55:50.527
what's with that outfit?

00:55:54.231 --> 00:55:56.700
Lose some weight and pretty yourself up...

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.935
for the final round.

00:55:58.736 --> 00:55:59.637
I will.

00:56:13.784 --> 00:56:14.885
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

00:56:17.855 --> 00:56:19.657
- The number you've dialed is unavailable.
- Seriously?

00:56:22.126 --> 00:56:23.761
Yes!

00:56:29.533 --> 00:56:31.402
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

00:56:43.914 --> 00:56:45.349
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:47.618
Why won't he pick up?

00:56:47.618 --> 00:56:49.753
I have to tell him this news right away.

00:56:55.492 --> 00:57:00.064
(2005
Na Jeong's Birthday 2)

00:57:00.297 --> 00:57:02.099
- You know what?
- What?

00:57:02.099 --> 00:57:05.269
I want to live a great life
doing my own thing.

00:57:05.669 --> 00:57:08.172
I want to be a truly capable woman.

00:57:08.172 --> 00:57:09.473
Then what about marriage?

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.108
Marriage?

00:57:11.308 --> 00:57:13.177
Why get married?

00:57:13.711 --> 00:57:16.780
For a woman,
marriage is a grave and hell.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.382
Doing it knowing that...

00:57:18.382 --> 00:57:20.818
means you're a fool
with a single-digit IQ.

00:57:21.252 --> 00:57:22.519
- Exactly.
- Yes.

00:57:22.519 --> 00:57:24.755
The ones I'll never understand...

00:57:25.189 --> 00:57:27.358
are women who let men control them.

00:57:27.358 --> 00:57:28.259
Exactly.

00:57:28.259 --> 00:57:30.494
Don't they have
any confidence in themselves?

00:57:30.828 --> 00:57:33.631
Why be hung up on men?

00:57:34.298 --> 00:57:35.266
Right.

00:57:35.432 --> 00:57:38.302
Let's not live trapped like that.

00:57:38.669 --> 00:57:40.471
Let's live freely.

00:57:40.471 --> 00:57:41.472
To the end!

00:57:41.472 --> 00:57:42.873
- Deal.
- That's right.

00:57:42.873 --> 00:57:43.774
To the end!

00:57:43.774 --> 00:57:44.608
Freely!

00:57:44.608 --> 00:57:46.143
Freedom!

00:57:56.587 --> 00:57:57.488
This is fun.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.036
Can we please go home now?
I have to go home.

00:58:12.036 --> 00:58:13.637
No way.

00:58:13.637 --> 00:58:16.340
Tonight we party full course
until the end.

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.142
Because...

00:58:18.142 --> 00:58:20.411
today is Na Jeong's birthday!

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.815
This time, full speed.

00:58:25.316 --> 00:58:26.984
Rocket ticket launch!

00:58:32.256 --> 00:58:33.257
Run.

00:58:33.257 --> 00:58:34.258
I'm dizzy.

00:58:34.992 --> 00:58:36.927
Hey, I'm dizzy.

00:58:40.698 --> 00:58:41.532
Run.

00:58:42.433 --> 00:58:43.434
Let's go.

00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:42.626
(Don't call me ma'am)

00:59:42.626 --> 00:59:44.495
With the final interview ahead,

00:59:44.495 --> 00:59:47.231
a perfect final look is essential.

00:59:47.231 --> 00:59:50.334
Fashionistas, will you report for duty?

00:59:50.334 --> 00:59:53.070
Rumor has it
that he's having an affair with Seon Min.

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:55.973
Don't tell me you're actually
in a special relationship with her.

00:59:55.973 --> 00:59:57.274
What's going on between you two?

00:59:57.274 --> 00:59:58.676
Hey, if things aren't working out,

00:59:58.676 --> 01:00:00.945
don't be embarrassed
and try marriage counseling.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.450
I dressed him, fed him,
and tucked him in for three years.

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.351
Then he dumped me.

01:00:07.351 --> 01:00:09.386
So a goodbye kiss
should be allowed, right?

01:00:09.386 --> 01:00:12.122
But are you really a show host
who's been out for six years?

01:00:12.122 --> 01:00:14.892
You look ready to sell everything out
starting tomorrow.

01:00:14.892 --> 01:00:17.194
This is your show host who has returned,
Cho Na Jeong.

01:00:19.463 --> 01:00:21.465
