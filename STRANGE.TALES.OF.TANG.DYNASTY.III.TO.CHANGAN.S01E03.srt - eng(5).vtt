[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty
Strange Tales III: To Chang'an]

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 3]

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.720
[Pei's Mansion]

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.600
Lu Lingfeng,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.070
something's not right.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.560
When we were at Weicheng Station,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.000
His Majesty wanted you
to stay in Chang'an.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.000
That clearly meant he wanted
to give you an important position.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.760
But now why are you
assigned to just protect

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.820
the Grand General?

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.440
How would I know?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.310
Any clues about that raptor?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.840
His Majesty has handed the case

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.240
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.400
I know even less about it.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.120
The only clue we have now is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.079
a feather Master Ji plucked

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.410
from the raptor's body.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.470
This looks like it!

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.190
Look!

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.310
Let me see it.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.360
Although I've never seen this bird before,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.750
from your earlier descriptions,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.840
I suspected it might be a Flame Crow.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.880
This feather indeed matches

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.310
the historical records.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.730
Look here.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.960
[Flame Crow]

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.680
This bird is enormous in size.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.240
Its neck resembles a vulture's,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.590
but it's red.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.650
On its black wings,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.430
there are red flame-like patterns.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.840
-That's right.
-That's right.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.970
It matches your description exactly.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.710
This Flame Crow

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.720
must be the king of the Crow's Cry Kingdom

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.400
mentioned in the Records of Anomalies.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.990
What is this Crow's Cry Kingdom?

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.520
According to legend,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.960
between the world
of the living and the dead,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.310
there exists a Crow's Cry Kingdom.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.560
In the center of this kingdom
stands a massive tree,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.970
with a circumference of hundreds of li.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.700
Millions of ferocious birds
perch on this tree.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.079
The most formidable among them

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.750
is this Flame Crow.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.240
A legendary ferocious bird
has appeared in our world?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.080
Su Wuming,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.960
that sounds a little

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.190
superstitious.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.520
Though it appears in legends,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.840
such birds do exist in our world.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.110
They do exist?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.080
Definitely not in the Tang Empire.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.680
Where does it originate from?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.040
This bird is native only to Amono,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.829
west of the Western Region.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.680
Isn't that the small country

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.480
that was destroyed
during Emperor Gaozong's reign?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.140
Yes.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.680
The Flame Crow was Amono's national bird.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.560
Its sense of smell is extremely keen,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.190
and it has a preference for sweet things.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.600
However,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.850
although this bird is fierce,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.620
there are no records of it eating humans.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.510
Hey!

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.880
I can't move,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.360
so you're all ignoring me?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.760
Let me in on what you're discussing!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480
My dear Miracle Doctor Fei,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.280
this time,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.720
you not only saved
the Grand General's life,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.670
but also risked your life
to taste the golden peach,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.600
sacrificing yourself to lure the raptor

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.070
and plucking one of its feathers.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.480
You've given us the opportunity

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.070
to identify its origin.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.050
You truly are vigorous despite your age,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.390
continuously achieving new merits!

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.680
You flatter me.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.240
Su Wuming.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.560
It sounds like you're mocking me.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.000
I'm not mocking you.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.680
It's all compliments.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.720
Yingtao is friend-worthy.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.120
Unlike Su Wuming,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.720
who's full of schemes

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.250
and completely apathetic.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.870
But I must say,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.750
you made a round trip

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.750
to Gantang County in just a few days.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.180
That's quite impressive.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.190
Miss Yingtao,

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.960
it must've been tiring.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.240
Indeed.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.010
It's all thanks to Yingtao.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.720
She immediately saw through

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.590
that gambling village elder's deception,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.360
making this trip to Gantang

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.690
extremely successful.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.720
Thank you, Yingtao.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.120
The elder's deception

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.360
was just too obvious.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.990
If I couldn't spot that,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.120
my time in the martial world
can be considered wasted.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.950
That...

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.830
Liu... Liu XVII?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.390
Was his face really skinned off?

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.750
Yes.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.950
These yin-yang merchants

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.210
are truly despicable.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.410
What do yin-yang merchants do?

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.690
They trade in the dead.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.250
They specifically deal in human hair,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.000
human skin,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.270
and even bones.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.600
I say they should be treated
as grave robbers,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.040
each deserving death by a thousand cuts.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.480
Right,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.150
death by a thousand cuts.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.950
Liu XVII

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.920
would never have thought

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.120
that his evil face

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.200
would be sold to Chang'an

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.510
and used to attack His Majesty.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.480
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.390
Sheriff Lu.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.060
Where are you heading?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.260
The Weicheng Station.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.870
Even if it was the Flame Crow,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.000
it couldn't have flown straight

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.870
from Amona.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.740
I suspect the person raising that raptor

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.680
has a hideout

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.200
near Weicheng Station.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.310
Also,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.870
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.680
that masked person

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.120
who ambushed you on the way

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.180
used a phoenix-winged gold halberd,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.230
which is quite rare.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.120
It's mostly used by troops
stationed at the borders.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.980
We must investigate thoroughly.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.190
You can't go.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.300
His Majesty ordered you
to protect Lu Tong,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.940
so you should return
to the Grand General's Mansion.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.190
This case is bizarre.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.480
That raptor

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.510
has injured people before my eyes twice.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.560
How can I stand by and do nothing?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.800
[Great virtue can carry the world]

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.159
As your personal secretary,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.000
I accompanied you westward.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.560
Despite countless dangers,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.680
I was fortunate to witness

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.750
the perseverance of you, Lu of Fanyang.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.040
"Now that His Majesty has issued an edict

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.500
for us return to Chang'an,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.600
I, Lu Lingfeng,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.870
will fight with all my might

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.160
for the Tang Empire."

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.720
These bold words

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.510
still ring in my ears.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.550
But now you've just returned

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.040
and you're already got yourself involved
in court politics.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.230
Don't you know

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.670
this is a taboo?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360
Of course I know.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.120
Then why did you

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.980
go inform Her Highness yourself?

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.100
As one's son,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.770
caring about your mother's safety
is filial piety.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.660
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.429
But that Attendant Yang

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.360
is cunning and vicious.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:35.960
If you're not careful,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.720
you'll fall into his trap.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.140
That'd cause His Majesty to be suspicious.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.330
Since things have come to this,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.390
you should return to Lu Tong's side,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.140
fulfill your duty as his guard,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.600
and never leave his side.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.660
What about the case, then?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.570
Leave it to me.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.720
Su Wuming,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.960
you're just a civilian.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.080
How could they possibly

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.000
entrust such an important case

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.720
to you?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.780
What you just said is correct,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.040
but it's all pointless talk.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.620
Right now,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.670
only by quickly uncovering the truth

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.790
and catching the culprit

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.030
can we resolve the misunderstanding

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.840
between His Majesty and Her Highness.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.500
Only then will His Majesty...

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.030
trust me again.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.030
As long as you get involved in this case,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.790
His Majesty will not trust you!

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.690
It might even

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.940
bring you deadly consequences.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.200
Return to the Grand General's Mansion
immediately.

no matter how far this case goes,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.200
you pay no heed.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.240

There's nothing to talk about it.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.120
Indeed.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.030
Chief Administrator Du,

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.720
I'd be really worried for you.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.510
Why?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.380
Just because of a bird,

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.630
could His Majesty really dismiss me

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.320
from my position
as Yongzhou's Chief Administrator?

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.720
It's not impossible.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.180
What are you trying to say?

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.730
What I'm saying is,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.720
the most important thing is,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.160
Chief Administrator Du, you...

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.950
which side are you on?

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.840
[Patriotic and devote to public service]

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.970
I've said it before,

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.120
I, Du Ming,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.590
am on the side of the Tang Empire.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.630
Yes, yes.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.720
We're on the Tang Empire's side.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.750
But to be specific,

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.810
you're still considered
to be on the Retired Emperor's side.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.960
After all, back then

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.670
you once served
in Prince Xiang's Mansion.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.470
My dear Chief Administrator Du,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.550
the situation is unpredictable now.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.050
One of these days,

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.960
if His Majesty is in a bad mood,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.020
he might just remove you from office.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.600
If you have something to say,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.800
just say it directly.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.070
Though unworthy,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.550
I am willing to help
Chief Administrator Du

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.840
assist Yongzhou Prefecture

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.960
to solve this mysterious case quickly.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.360
That won't be necessary.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.210
Cen Zhi is dead.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.120
He died on his way to the palace.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.480
And those who ate the golden peach,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.960
as long as they stay
within the Princess's Mansion,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.270
they will stay perfectly safe.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:21.840
Furthermore,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.150
the evil bird at Weicheng Station

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.080
didn't attack Lu Lingfeng at all.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.760
Su Wuming.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.540
Though I'm not Master Di's disciple,

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.360
I'm not a fool either.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.490
Is there even a need
to investigate this case?

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.280
Should I investigate
the Princess's Mansion

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.390
or Lu Lingfeng?

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.320
You think His Majesty

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.780
doesn't know everything?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.250
Stop causing more trouble.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.660
Just go.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.050
My son has been back
in the capital for days.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.030
He performed great service protecting
the imperial convoy at Weicheng Station.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.000
Yet he wasn't
awarded any official position.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.870
Instead, he was assigned to guard

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.310
a blind man named Lu Tong.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.030
Isn't this clearly

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.550
meant to humiliate me?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.690
The fault here... lies with His Majesty?

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.910
It's not his fault,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.790
is it mine?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.390
Did Cen Zhi ever betray Your Highness?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.440
Forgive my impertinence,

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.390
but the only person who ate
the golden peach you bestowed

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.430
and then left the Princess's Mansion

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.350
was Cen Zhi.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.480
As the military officer of your household,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.920
he was killed by the raptor,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.390
yet Your Highness showed no concern.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.250
What will everyone

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.860
at court think of this?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.960
What they think

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.470
is none of my concern.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.000
Cen Zhi lost an arm

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.590
saving my life.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.240
His loyalty was commendable.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.150
After his death,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
I ordered to provide compensation
in silver and gold,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.700
but couldn't find
any of his family members.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.000
What a pity.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.650
Let's not speak of this.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.510
I can't let you come for nothing.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.840
Let me offer you a peach.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.210
A golden peach from the Kang Kingdom.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.080
I'll pass on the peach.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.120
Why?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.340
Afraid you'll end up like Cen Zhi?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.510
I, Su Wuming,

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.600
truly fear death.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.130
More importantly, if I die,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.170
there will be no one left

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.360
to clear Lu Lingfeng's name.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.930
What do you mean?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.120
The golden peach from the Kang Kingdom

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.480
was escorted here
by Lu Lingfeng personally.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.120
That man-attacking raptor from the west

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.200
must be from the Western Region.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.220
Lu Lingfeng noticed

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.550
that the raptor's attacks
were related to the golden peach.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.000
So he rushed to
the Princess's Mansion to report

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.480
and personally protect
Your Highness's safety.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.240
Meanwhile,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.150
you hosted grand golden peach banquets,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.120
yet still remained unharmed for days.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.410
How could His Majesty not be suspicious?

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.960
Having Lu Lingfeng
stay at the Grand General's Mansion

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.240
to protect Lu Tong

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.840
is just an excuse.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.630
Now

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.440
Lu Lingfeng's life hangs by a thread.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.550
I'd like to see him dare touch my son.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.670
Yes.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.510
Your Highness has great influence.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.700
His Majesty wouldn't dare act rashly.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.610
But if we don't uncover the truth

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.520
and clear Lu Lingfeng's name,

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.000
he will eventually be framed

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320
and die unjustly.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:37.960
Shut up.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.600
No wonder you're so earnest.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.440
You're here to ask
for an official position, aren't you?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.300
I'll grant you

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.510
the position of Chief Justice,

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.150
and you take office immediately.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.010
Your Highness.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.270
You shouldn't joke like this.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.510
Do you think

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.110
I don't have such authority?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.590
No, no.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.360
Whoever Your Highness wants
as Chief Justice,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.240
I believe

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.610
that person will

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.510
certainly secure that position.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.060
But I am currently

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.240
just a commoner.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.030
You're offering me a third-rank position

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.480
which is too high.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.140
The bureaucratic procedures

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.700
would be troublesome.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.840
This case is at a critical moment.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.600
If we don't solve it quickly,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.680
we'll miss the golden time.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.720
It might remain unsolved forever.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.840
Lu Lingfeng might never

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.460
be cleared of suspicion too.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.480
Right now,

no progress on this case—

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.790
The case was assigned to Du Ming?

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.360
Indeed.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.840
That incompetent fool

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.900
knows nothing about investigation.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.000
Exactly!

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.050
Starting today,

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.790
I appoint you

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.600
as the Criminal Investigation Scholar
of Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.440
It sounds novel?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.480
That's the point.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.390
In our Tang Empire,
we have Classics Scholars,

Adding a Criminal Investigation Scholar
won't hurt.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.030
You'll report directly
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.390

Ask.

That raptor truly wasn't raised by you?

Even if you didn't raise it,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.080
it must have something

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.720
to do with the Princess's Mansion, right?

is smart and intelligent.]

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.030
[He has sharp eyes and ears,
and is smart and capable.
From today onwards,]

00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.900
[he shall be appointed
the Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou]

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.330
[Letter of appointment]

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:05.750
[He shall be appointed to investigate
the devil bird case.]

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.680
Su Wuming.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.680
You claim to be above it all,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.700
yet you accept this irregular appointment?

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.950
I don't appreciate what you're saying.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.270
This scholar position of mine

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.640
isn't even a proper official post,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.170
not at all.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.200
How can you call it
an irregular appointment?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.310
It's not an official post?

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.480
Of course it's not!

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.240
It's because the Princess is eager
to solve the case

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.960
and ordered me
to supervise Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.310
It's just a title.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.750
If that's the case,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.570
then Yongzhou Prefecture

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.440
won't provide you any salary?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.240
Hey!

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.610
Wouldn't that be taking advantage of me?

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.280
You want to solve cases

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.680
and make a name in history.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.720
Can't you endure this small inconvenience?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.480
Besides, not giving you a salary

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.540
is my stance as Chief Administrator.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.790
This stance is for

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.810
those higher-up to see.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.640
Therefore,

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.240
I ask Scholar Su to understand
Yongzhou Prefecture's situation

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.480
and my predicament.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.210
You're really something.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.880
Guards!

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.410
Yes, sir.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.720
Summon Official Wu.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.410
Yes, sir.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.680
I, Wu Wenbin,
the Judicial Official,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.210
pay respects to Scholar Su.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.940
Wu Wenbin.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.460
Su Wuming is Master Di's disciple

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.610
who solved the Cantian Tower case

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.420
and the Chengfo Temple mystery.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.430
Have you heard of him?

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.520
Of course I have.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.640
Scholar Su is renowned.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.640
It's my honor to investigate

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.500
this case under

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.650
your supervision.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.640
But there are few clues in this case.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.720
It's currently stalled.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.920
Where should we begin?

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.270
I'll follow Scholar Su's lead

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.130
and provide my full cooperation.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.000
Tell me then.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.680
Are there
any missing persons cases recently?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.480
Yongzhou is densely populated,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.790
so such unfortunate incidents

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.880
do occur.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.830
Then let me ask you,

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.490
are there any cases
where faces were peeled off?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.020
Actually, yes.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.710
I just reported one
to Chief Administrator Du yesterday.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.360
Quickly,

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.120
take me to examine the body.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.210
Note this down:

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.940
the skin above the neck

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.140
and below the scalp was all peeled off.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.140
The wound edges
are curled with blood seepage.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.110
It appears to have been done
while the victim was unconscious,

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.000
or possibly even while conscious.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.260
The wounds are clean,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.890
suggesting the work
of an experienced perpetrator.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.200
She was a dancer.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.240
Such a frivolous and loose woman

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.100
murdered in her own residence

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.640
should be a crime of passion.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.360
Did you find her lovers?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.610
We found two of them.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.240
But they had alibis.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.240
So how could it be a crime of passion?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.000
Yongzhou Prefecture is vast,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.920
with many cases.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.200
Given her status,

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.410
I indeed didn't take it seriously,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.880
and my subordinates were negligent.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.920
However, Dr. Su,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.790
Her Highness sent you
to Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.050
not to investigate a mere dancer, right?

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.590
So what if she was a dancer?

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.440
Wasn't she still a citizen
of the Tang Empire?

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.900
You're just an attendant,

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.880
how dare you speak to me like this!

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.310
Hey!

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.320
Official Wu,

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.270
my attendant

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.590
speaks her mind freely

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.120
and means no offense.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:14.920
But,

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.350
she is right.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.440
Take me to the victim's residence.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.940
Bring Xijun along.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.400
Su Wuming.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.640
Although this area is within
Pingkang District,

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.960
it's quite secluded.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.400
Any commotion inside the courtyard

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.730
wouldn't be easily noticed from outside.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.310
Brother.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.920
The drawing is finished.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.510
I fear most
when terrible incidents like this

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.110
happen in the neighborhood.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.240
I want to move away.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.590
Did my sister draw her accurately?

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.110
Yes,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200
very accurate.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.530
It's exactly like her.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.110
She had a really seductive gaze.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.480
I wouldn't even let my husband

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.540
look at her twice.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.160
She looked exactly like that drawing.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:38.880
What's this?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.680
Thank you for your help, Sister.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.480
Who's there?

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.510
Stop right there!

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.110
Jia!

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.060
You're with these three?

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.180
Official Wu,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.030
there's a misunderstanding.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.960
These three

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.030
are old acquaintances of mine.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.640
They are the famous

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.400
Three Great Constables of Chang'an County.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:34.910
Jia, Luo, and Liu.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.280
[The Three Chang'an Constables,
Jia]

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:35.980
[The Three Chang'an Constables,
Luo]

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.570
[The Three Chang'an Constables,
Liu]

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.330
They're famous?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.340
How come I've never heard of them?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.810
Never heard of them?

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.290
That can't be right.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.270
I understand now.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.400
That's because you

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.200
have only recently arrived
in Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.270
so that's why...

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.200
These three

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.960
made great contributions

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.200
to the Red Tea Case in Chang'an,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.510
the Cantian Tower Case,

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.570
and the Demon King Escape
at Chengfo Temple.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.260
If they're officials,

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.750
why were they sneaking around like this?

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.560
Indeed.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.720
What's going on

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.970
with you three?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
We heard you have returned to Chang'an,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.110
so we came to visit you.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.310
But this district
isn't under Chang'an's jurisdiction,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.960
so we dressed in plain clothes.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.410
You have offended many powerful people,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.500
so we must be cautious.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.070
Exactly.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.240
Exactly.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.470
Look.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.540
It was truly a misunderstanding.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.800
You three.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:28.940
This is

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.790
the Judicial Official
of Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.390
Wu Wenbin.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.500
Say your greetings to your superior.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.040
Greetings, Official Wu.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.720
I'll leave you to catch up.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.960
If you find any important leads,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.000
I'll return to assist.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.030
Very well.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.250
Take care, Official Wu.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.480
Minister Su, have you been well?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.590
That startled me.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.160
Yes!

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.510
But I'm no longer a minister.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.070
From now on, you can call me

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.890
Scholar Su.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.910
Scholar?

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.350
What rank is that?

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.720
Well...

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.500
I'm not allowed to say.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.480
Basically, I'm supervising

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.680
major cases for Yongzhou Prefecture
on behalf of the imperial court.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.970
My goodness!

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.060
That must be a very high position!

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.410
Congratulations on your promotion,
Scholar Su!

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.680
Thank you.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.400
Thank you.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.110
This woman is beautiful.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.440
Even in Chang'an,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.830
a face like hers

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920
would be considered exceptional,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.440
right?

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.370
Help me find her.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.310
Rest assured, Scholar Su.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.550
As constables of the Tang Empire,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.750
to protect Chang'an,

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.400
we three will brave any danger...

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.280
Even at the cost of our lives!

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.160
Having brave men like Jia, Luo, and Liu

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.070
is Chang'an's fortune
and the people's blessing.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.680
Please accept

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.160
our bow.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.520
This... this...

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.720
Master Qu.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:49.310
Why not let your wife join us

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.270
for a drink?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.790
Yes.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.050
Well...

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.920
To be honest,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.240
we've been discussing business

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.920
for so long

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.660
without making any progress.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.430
My wife is worried,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.750
so she's not in the mood.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.960
Business can be easily discussed.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.860
Master Qu has sincerely invited us today,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.350
so let's settle it now.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.960
Me too!

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.110
Are you willing to settle?

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.480
Of course, of course.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.690
There we go!

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.830
Well then.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.770
I

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.620
toast to you three gentlemen.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.400
-Come on.
-Come on.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.620
The owner's surname is Qu.
He's a merchant.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.750
He just bought this residence

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.160
and moved in the very next day.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.680
He used to live in Dunyi District.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.160
He found his wife ugly,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.750
so he never allowed her to be seen.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.010
But after moving here,

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.470
he hosts guests every day

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.920
with his wife entertaining
and serving drinks.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.310
The neighbors who've met her

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.570
all praise her beauty.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.510
Apparently she's good at singing
and dancing too.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.480
They say she looks

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.540
just like the woman in that painting.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.030
You've investigated so thoroughly.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.070
It's been a year since we last met

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.730
and you three have become
even more impressive.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.270
You flatter us.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640
It's not us

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.030
but our informants who are remarkable.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:34.960
Your informants...

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.920
As constables,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.440
without informants' help,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.100
how could we catch criminals?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.110
I understand now.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.160
You found me today

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.080
because of information
from your informants.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:47.790
Got it.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.640
My dear.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.280
My dear.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.420
Tonight...

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.740
Tonight

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.680
was all thanks to you.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.160
How suffocating.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.830
I don't want this face anymore.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.270
You mustn't, my dear!

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.960
I spent three gold coins

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.860
to buy this.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.550
I helped you close deals today.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.270
You've already earned
many gold coins from that.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.160
It's so itchy.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.440
I want to tear it off.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.510
No, you mustn't!

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.680
I know it's hard for you.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:29.960
But

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.310
I truly love this face.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.960
If you keep wearing it,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.290
I'll treat you well
for the rest of my life.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.070
Do you love me

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.000
or just this face?

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.530
On this lovely night,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.110
we should enjoy ourselves
as husband and wife

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.510
and not think about these useless matters.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640
My dear.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.770
Please spare me, sir!

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:13.350
Go!

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.770
Let's talk this through!

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.070
Please spare me, sir! Mercy!

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.200
Mercy, sir!

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.440
I have silver and gold!

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.660
Take it all!

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.880
Just spare this worthless life!

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.440
You fool!

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.370
You think I'm a thief?

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.160
Open your damn eyes!

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.110
We are the Three Great Constables
of Chang'an!

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.200
For your crimes,
we're arresting you today!

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.640
We've caught you red-handed!

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.030
I...

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.030
Look!

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.510
This is Scholar Su.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.350
He's a high official
governing all of Yongzhou Prefecture

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.240
with authority
to execute first and report later.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240
If you don't want to die,

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.920
confess everything honestly!

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.310
I'll confess! I'll confess!

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.080
Sir,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.380
what crime have I committed?

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.970
The person inside has already confessed.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.600
He changed

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.590
her face

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.640
for her.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.480
The owner of that face

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.270
was a dancer from Pingkang District.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.160
You killed someone and skinned their face.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.200
That's so cruel.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.000
What punishment do you deserve?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.160
I'm wronged!

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.090
I'm wronged!

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:13.880
I bought this face

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.440
with three gold coins

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.550
from someone.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.070
From whom did you buy it?

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.790
I don't know their name.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.590
But you can describe their face?

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.680
Yes!

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.740
Yes!

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.230
Keep this quiet.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.640
Take this man

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.920
to Yongzhou Prison.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:34.590
Yes!

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.550
Hey!

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.030
Sir!

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.440
-Go!
-Go!

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.020
I don't know anything!

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.480
Go!

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.400
I'm wronged!

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.200
Quickly get Xijun to draw a portrait.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.550
Sir!

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.880
I am the best yin-yang merchang

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.350
in all of Chang'an

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.630
and throughout the Tang Empire.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:55.000
How's that?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.550
Take a look at what I've brought.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.070
Poet.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.960
Merchant.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.750
General.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.110
Choose one.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.200
This one is still the best.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.550
Young and handsome,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.400
with a touch of darkness.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.400
This is how I was meant to be.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.070
But you can't use

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.100
this face anymore.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.640
Your master

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.790
wants you to change it.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.530
He is not my master!

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.720
I am no one's slave.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.030
No one can control me.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.240
I will be the master of my own fate.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.510
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.750
I misspoke.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.020
After all, he's the one with the money.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.310
Considering all the money

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.310
he's paid you,

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.000
please change to another face.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.510
No!

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.350
This face,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.030
I like it very much.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.030
Get out!

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.440
This person has many faces

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.240
and can transform
into a woman's face at will.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.680
But he uses this mostly.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.610
Everyone come look.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.810
Have you seen this person?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.590
No.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.240
Never seen him.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.320
Someone in this line of work

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:58.920
probably

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.100
lives in the Ghost Market.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.590
Fei.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.010
Miracle Doctor Fei!

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.950
Who needs treatment?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.830
Look at your condition.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.960
Who would seek treatment from you?

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.490
Come here

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.090
and take a look at this.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.000
Do you know

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.110
this person?

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.360
The Ever-changing Master.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.030
The Ever-changing Master?

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.790
When you mentioned

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.350
the yin-yang merchants,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.990
I immediately thought of him.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.850
In the Ghost Market,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.050
he's the most famous in this business.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.440
Back when I frequented

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440
the Ghost Market,

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.610
this old fox was already well-known.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.440
I'll never forget

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.030
this face!

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.100
Scholar Su.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.920
When we arrive at the Ghost Market,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.179
don't get frightened.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.550
Thanks for the reminder.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.360
This isn't my first visit.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.880
Official Wu, this isn't

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.540
your first time either, is it?

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.150
Indeed.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.440
As a Judicial Official in Chang'an,

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.239
I have to visit

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.590
this Ghost Market from time to time.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.760
The Ever-changing Master's residence

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.360
is behind the Ghost Market's Yin Mountain

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.440
next to the Earth God Temple.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.320
Our scouts report

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.550
he hasn't left the Ghost Market for days.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.070
So

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.239
we should get something today.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.449
Official Wu,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.590
you've gathered
all this information overnight.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.320
Truly impressive efficiency.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.590
I'm impressed.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.659
Scholar Su.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.960
I don't quite understand.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.280
Is this yin-yang merchant

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.400
connected to the attack on His Majesty

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.600
at Weicheng Station?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.210
Whether there's a connection,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.460
it is hard to say right now.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.700
It's truly uncertain.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.280
This is the place.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.230
Wait for me here.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.460
I'll bring him out.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:31.670
Wait.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.670
I think

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.360
we should try diplomacy before force.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.230
The two of us will go in to investigate,

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.630
while you stay outside

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.980
as backup. How's that?

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.460
As you wish.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.010
Let's go.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.180
Is the master home?

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.440
I'm here on business,

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.800
so I'll just come in.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.600
Cover your face.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.750
Sir,

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.450
you must be the Ever-changing Master?

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.960
It's like this.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.190
This is my niece.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.680
She was once beautiful,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.230
but unfortunately suffered burns

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.880
in a fire.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.440
She can't even find a husband now.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.840
So

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.240
we've come seeking your help.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.670
Do you know the price?

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.600
Yes.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.070
Three gold coins.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280
I have them ready.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.070
Then make your choice.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.960
Choose one.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.960
Niece,

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.960
do you see one you like?

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.630
No! No!

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.590
I heard these

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.760
are all peeled off

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.630
from dead people's faces.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.240
Nonsense!

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:57.970
Those are just rumors.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.030
Of course they're rumors.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.320
How could something
peeled from a dead face

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.280
be as tender and fresh as mine?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.760
The reason it costs three gold coins

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.760
is because it was skinned alive—

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.920
no easy task.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.280
You beast!

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.280
Those girls were so young

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.190
when you...

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.480
Yingtao!

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.670
Don't be rash.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.150
Ever-changing Master.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.920
Let me ask you.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.150
Have you sold this face mask before?

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.480
I've handled so many

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.230
I really can't remember.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.590
Can't remember?

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.550
I'll smash you to death!

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.070
Yingtao!

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.510
I think

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.800
we should take him

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.710
back to the office for questioning first.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.480
Official Wu is right.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.760
Su Wuming!

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.400
Save me!

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.440
Save me!

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.400
Su Wuming!

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.760
Su Wuming!

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.210
Su Wuming!

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.110
Xijun?

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.480
Lu Lingfeng!

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:02.840
What happened?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.590
My brother was taken

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.190
by that human-face raptor
at the ghost market!

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.550
I've already sent people

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.400
to search for Su Wuming
throughout the city.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.110
Any news?

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.510
Nothing yet.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.110
It's all my fault.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.880
That bird had a human face

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.400
and could shoot crossbow arrows.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.130
It was completely unexpected.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.280
And that Ever-changing Master
who was already caught

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.440
also escaped during the chaos.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.710
Self-blame is useless.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.710
Send more people.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.480
Don't overlook
the rural counties outside the city.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.030
Search for Scholar Su with all your might.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.510
Yes.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.000
[Yongzhou's Mansion]

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.800
How's it going?

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.330
Any clues about my brother?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.130
Since it happened at the ghost market,

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.030
we'll start our investigation there.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.480
Xijun,

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.330
stay here and take care of Fei.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.280
Everyone else,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.200
follow me to the ghost market.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:55.120
