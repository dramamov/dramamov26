00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.440
Brother Jin

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.840
Lin Wancheng's ginseng

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.280
Is it real or fake?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280
His is real.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.360
It's real.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.920
The Seven Fairies my father dug up

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.040
Actually,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.120
was a Yin-Yang Twin Ginseng.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.600
Two roots grew back to back,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.600
nourishing each other.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.600
It's truly rare.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.840
My father only showed one root to outsiders.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.240
So no one knew this ginseng

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.240
was actually two roots.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.000
Uncle Luo never opened it.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.400
So he didn't know either.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.080
You really took a risk today.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.240
If Boss He wanted both roots,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.840
wouldn't your plan fail?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.560
Don't worry.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.120
He's a businessman.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.400
Businessmen only care about business.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.360
He only cares about profit.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.040
As they say, rarity makes value.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.400
If something becomes common,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
it loses its worth.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.480
What if he wants Lin Wancheng's root?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.680
The Seven Fairies my father found

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.800
was famous everywhere.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.280
Only with me alive

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.120
can this Seven Fairies

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.840
be proven as the one

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.480
everyone sought and prized.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.160
Someone's coming.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.160
They brought the person to you.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.680
He's still breathing.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.400
The favor for the Seven Fairies is repaid.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200
Boss He, you're too polite.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.840
Speaking of favors,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.480
it's the younger generation who owes you.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.040
If Boss He ever

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.720
needs my help in the future,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.160
just say the word.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.160
At the Lin family banquet,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.520
I heard of your skill in judging ginseng.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
Now I've seen your methods.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.960
You're someone who can achieve great things.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.800
These are all the Lin family's businesses.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.800
They're yours now.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880
Our Liuhe Tang in the capital

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.080
is top-ranked.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.160
But in Songling, we have no foundation.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.720
From now on in Songling,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.600
we'll need your support, Boss Jin.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.720
Let's go.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360
Jin Shisan

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.360
This overwhelming fortune

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.720
you must hold onto it well.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.160
Boss Lin

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800
You and my father were sworn brothers.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.080
I call you Qi Ye out of respect.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.720
I invited you here today,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.880
to ask, before my father's spirit,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.720
for the truth.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.360
Three years ago at the Mountain God Temple,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.000
what really happened?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.080
Your father grew greedy,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.240
and angered the Mountain God.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.360
Old man, you're almost full of holes,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.160
yet still stubborn.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.520
My father lived an honest life.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.600
He refused to join people like you.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.720
That's why he retired for years.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.880
Three years ago,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.160
he was called back by you all.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.240
You were just a kid, not even grown.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.720
Honest and pure.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.520
Too much purity leaves no fish.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.640
Nowadays, too much honesty

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.800
just means saying goodbye.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.800
You

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.040
know what Dragon-Phoenix Twin Ginseng is?

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.200
The dragon ginseng is the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.480
Back then, Duan Lao Jiu heard somewhere

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.640
that the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng appeared in northwest Changbai Mountain.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.760
Your father went after this king of ginseng.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.920
Dad, you retired for so many years,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.080
why join this time?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
It finally appeared.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.640
What appeared?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.480
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.640
A once-in-a-century rarity.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.480
Duan Lao Jiu invited your father

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.360
on behalf of the Ginseng Guild.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.040
Lao Jiu

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.200
You stubborn old man.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.200
You overestimate yourself.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.440
You shouldn't have competed with him.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.000
Seems only by getting the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.760
will the fish reveal itself.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.000
Come out.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.520
You're a woman,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.640
spying on two men at night, aren't you ashamed?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.920
Forget about him,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.800
what's there to see about you?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.520
A hairy little dwarf.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.640
I wondered who it was.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.640
Turns out it's the Yang family's second miss.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.720
Didn't know Miss Yang came here

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440
to watch the show?

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.240
Of course, it's not just for the show.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.240
Mainly, I came to see you.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.920
Don't get me wrong.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.200
I just guessed

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.080
you'd join this year's Grand Mountain Assembly.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.440
Know yourself and your enemy, win every battle.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.200
I'm here to check out my rival early.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.240
Seems I've found

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.800
I'm no match for you.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.640
That's right.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.920
We might even become teammates.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.200
Brother Jin

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.000
Yang Tingxuan brought people to surround the mortuary.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.920
What?

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.640
Darn it.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.720
Compass.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.520
Who is it?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.600
So noisy at night.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.160
It's the eldest son of the Yang family.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.320
What brings you here?

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.200
Master Luo

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.040
Jin Shisan and the Nine Immortals' Compass

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.320
I must take them today.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.360
Please make it easy for me, Master Luo.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.640
You're disturbing my sleep at night,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.920
and want me to help you?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.640
Neither the person nor the compass is here.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.040
Please leave.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720
Master Luo

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.160
Just by your word,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.640
I can't explain to the Ginseng Guild.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.520
How about this:

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.880
I'll let two men go in and check.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.000
How about it?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.200
You have many people,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800
my place is small.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.000
If you really want to squeeze in,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.360
go ahead.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.040
Why are you all backing off?

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.200
You two, get inside.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.720
Yes, yes.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.560
Surround them.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.680
Wait.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.400
Who goes there?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.560
Second Miss.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.280
Where's my brother?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.960
He's in the front yard.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.400
Everyone, fall back.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:23.960
Yes.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.520
Go.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.280
Jinzi.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.880
Keep the compass safe.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.960
You and Baobao, hurry and leave.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.680
Alright.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.120
There are people everywhere outside.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.080
We can't fight head-on.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.520
We need a plan.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.640
Come with me.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.320
Yang Tingxuan.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.640
What are you trying to do?

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.520
Why make such a scene?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.200
Brat, what are you doing here?

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.400
Enough, enough. Stay out of this.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640
I've discussed it with Qi Ye.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.640
I'm here for the Ginseng Guild to reclaim the compass.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.560
And to teach this brat a lesson.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.200
No, brother—

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.680
Did you ever consider—

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.760
If Qi Ye agreed to this,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.120
then why hasn't anyone from the Duan family

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.280
shown up at all?

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.760
You—

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.960
Young Master Yang.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.440
So many people came.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.520
I'm truly honored.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760
If you want the compass,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.320
come and get it.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.760
Catch them! After them!

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.280
Yes!

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.280
Stop! Move!

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.880
Split up and chase!

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.400
Go separately! After them!

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.280
This way!

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.840
Don't run!

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.320
Stop!

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.400
Everyone, follow!

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.520
Jinzi.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.960
Brother Jinzi.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.760
You're the smart one.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.840
We're a big group, easy to spot.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.560
Split up into smaller groups.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.400
We weren't caught after all.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.000
Someone's tailing us.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.000
A tail?

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.520
No wonder you're the Yang family's Second Miss.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.000
You still managed to keep up.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.640
Jin Shisan.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.680
I mean no harm.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.200
My brother was just used as a pawn.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:47.960
Shisan.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.680
Let's go.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.200
If you want to uncover the truth from back then,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.280
I can help you.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.640
We walk different paths.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.000
Opposing the Ginseng Guild

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.440
won't do you any good.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.280
Did I come back for personal gain?

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.200
Everyone, be careful.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.080
Go.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.640
Brother!

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.960
I'm still here!

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.120
Brother!

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.080
Brother, it's me!

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.200
Brother!

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.200
I'm here!

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.840
Jinzi.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.400
Jin Shisan.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.280
Darn it, I'll fight them!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.640
Brother!

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:17.680
Go, quickly!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.840
Head to Eagle's Sorrow Cliff!

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.680
Baobao.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.200
Chase them!

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440
He can't have gone far.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.120
Go, check over there.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.000
I'll go that way.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.400
Be careful.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.000
Are you alright?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.520
I'm fine.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.440
Something's off.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.760
The soil here is strange.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.680
Why can't I sense any living thing?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.640
What's with your nose?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.520
Are you part dog?

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.000
The earth is mother to all things.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.960
It can tell us a lot.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.760
This is the shaman's forbidden ground.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.280
It's normal not to sense life here.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.080
Because those who enter alive

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.640
never leave alive.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.000
So what do we do?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Chase them! Yes!

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.520
Jinzi.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.880
Looks like they're catching up.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.520
Hurry, go!

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.440
Brother Jinzi.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.000
The fog is getting thicker.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.960
Chase! Hurry!

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.680
Jinzi.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.000
The pursuers are getting closer.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:18.840
Quick!

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.400
Put out the fire.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.520
Come with me.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.280
Come, slow down.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.320
What's going on?

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.960
How did we get from the woods to here?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.560
Brother Jinzi.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.280
Should we look for a door?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.200
Right, find a door first.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.560
This is Eagle's Sorrow Cliff's forbidden ground.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.760
If you want to get out,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.440
you must offer your life as a sacrifice.
