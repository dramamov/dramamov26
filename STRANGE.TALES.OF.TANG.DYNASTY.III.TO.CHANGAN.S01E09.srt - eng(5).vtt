[Episode 9]

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.170
And since you injured Liu,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.620
I'm going to kill you!

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.280
Wait!

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.000
You can kill me,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560
but before you do it,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.509
please,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.400
help me find this golden tablet.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.350
It concerns the very fate
of the Tang Empire.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.590
What golden tablet?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.870
This golden tablet...

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.290
There's a thief on the rafters!

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.830
Don't move!

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.840
He must be the one
who stole the golden tablet!

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.870
Catch him!

[Sublime Virtue]

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.010
I'm just a treasure hunter.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.370
The golden tablet is on me;

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.120
take it.

[to absolve all of her sins.]

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.150
My client said

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.220
he'd pay me 10 gold coins
for this golden tablet.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.840
What's your client's name?

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.640
I don't know.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.400
He dressed like a hermit,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.150
with white hair and beard,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.000
but his face

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.320
looked quite young.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.560
How did you know?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.520
Wu Zhao of Zhou?

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.130
This thing you're looking for

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.400
is no ordinary item.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.080
If you find it,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.850
there will be
7 more coins waiting for you.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.920
If you already have so much gold,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.280
why spend it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.340
to find other gold?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.060
Even if the tablet is special,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.030
it's still just made of gold.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.400
You treasure hunters

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.730
have one rule to follow—

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.240
ask only what the task is,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.560
not why.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:36.880
Otherwise...

Otherwise, we'll die.

[Treasure Hunter]

Forgive my prying.

I'll take the job.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.960
But...

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.560
are you sure the treasure is in Chang'an?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.150
Yes.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.150
How do I contact you when I find it?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.470
You have one month.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.380
At the end of the month,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.640

Is this him?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.240
It's him.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.360
You must recall carefully

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.560
and provide us clues.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.510
That way you could redeem yourself
through merit.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.240
Tell me,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.430
that day, when you were drinking
at the restaurant,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.269
did anyone mention the Empress's affair?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.480
Yes.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.680
So I'm telling you,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.590
what's recorded in the Chronicles of Shasi

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.000
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.150
I was completely captivated.

[Law Before Power]

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.430
The hermit was so happy to hear that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.110
and even raised a toast to them.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.640
However,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.270
he might not have been genuinely happy.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.070
What do you mean?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.130
In our line of work,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.790
observation is crucial.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.980

Move.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920
Those who drank with him said

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.120
Kuai Wu could really hold his liquor,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.520
so he couldn't have been drunk that night.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.950
Looks like whether he was drunk or not

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.190
had nothing to do
with his alcohol tolerance.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.190
The hermit must have drugged him.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.800
Kneel!

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.150
Why are you treating an old man like that?

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.010
He injured Liu.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.500
I'd kill him if I could!

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.940
Did you hear that, Tao?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.480
If you don't confess truthfully,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.810
you'll come to a bad end.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.680
[Discipline and Service]

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.360
You turned your home into a temple,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.630
and the purple-robed,
handsome bearded man you worship

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.540
looks much like Zhangsun Wuji.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.940
You even call him Duke Zhao when praying.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.470
Then there's no mistake.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.430
The statues kneeling in front of him

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.040
must be Xu Jingzong, Li Yifu,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.200
and Yuan Gongyu.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.000
Do you really think staying silent

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
can hide who you are?

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.870
You claim

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.940
this golden tablet

Let me see

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600
what this is.

in the first year of Jiushi,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.560
The Empress, still on the throne,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.270
went to Sanyang Palace on Mount Shicong

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.750
and ordered Daoist Hu Chao
to climb Mount Song

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.600
and cast a golden tablet from Junji Peak

and cleanse her sins.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.830
This must be it.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.120
Why is it in your house,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.920
weighed down by a stone?

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.070
Who exactly are you?

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.920
Now can you talk?

[Mr. Tao, Charcoal Seller]

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.560

[Li Fengjie,
Old Courtier of the Eastern Capital]

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.510
and some skill in martial arts.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.000
Later, I roamed the capital

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.850
and accused an official of wrongdoing.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.390
That was about 50 years ago, wasn't it?

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.370
How do you know?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360
My mentor, Master Di,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.030
mentioned your name

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.130
while telling me about court affairs.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.680
I'm just a rogue.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.120
I don't deserve to be mentioned

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.600
by Master Di.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.680
When Emperor Gaozong was on the throne,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.190
the Empress wanted to remove

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.850
Duke Zhao, Zhangsun Wuji.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.390
Her confidant Xu Jingzong

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.770
saw an opportunity

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.190
and accused Duke Zhao

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.430
of forming a faction

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.080
with the official I accused,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.280
plotting rebellion,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.650
and even asked me to fabricate evidence.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.610
Later, Duke Zhao was demoted

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.080
and forced to commit suicide,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.480
and the Empress
officially took power after that.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.840
When the dust settled

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.870
and I saw the truth,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.870
I was full of regret.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I was afraid,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.120
afraid of being silenced by villains,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.360
so I changed my name

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.910
and became a coal seller.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.930
All these years,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.080
I have regretted it

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.600
constantly.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.390
I failed Duke Zhao

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and brought harm to the Tang Empire.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.720
So...

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.270
you turned your house

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.630
into a temple

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.830
to worship Duke Zhao?

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.390
Yes.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.600
Since then,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.630
I would rather stay in temples

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.840
than live in that house.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.860
I have no face

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.570
to share a home with Duke Zhao.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.480
Where did you

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.600
get this golden tablet?

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.000
It should have been thrown off

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.240
Junji Peak on Mount Song

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.790
13 years ago.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.480
I got it 13 years ago.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.440
Wu Zhao persecuted loyal officials

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.440
and then subverted the Tang Empire.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.480
She wanted to use this golden tablet to
dispel misfortune and cleanse her sins.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.120
How could I let her succeed?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.080
I searched under the cliff

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.870
for 49 days,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.590
fought all kinds of dangerous animals,

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.690
and finally

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.430
found the golden tablet.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.600
I weighed it down
with a stone from Mount Tai

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.860
and placed it before Duke Zhao's statue.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.440
I wanted to make sure Wu Zhao

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.720
would have no chance to atone

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.910
and rise again.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.510
I understand your hatred

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.390
of the Empress,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.030
but why did you try to kill Wu Yang?

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.270
Kill Wu Yang?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.870
I didn't.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.550
You still won't admit it?

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.010
I heard it with my own ears.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.670
Yes.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.320
I originally planned to kill Wu Yang,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.700
but I failed.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.560
For that,

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.080
I even stood before Duke Zhao's statue

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.870
to beg forgiveness.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.630
Why did you want to kill Wu Yang?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.070
Rumors in Chang'an say

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.670
the Empress
will be reborn and take the throne again,

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.730
and some even claim

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.200
Wu Zhao has already reincarnated

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.870
and she's right in Shengye District.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.550
I searched all over Shengye District

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.080
and discovered that Wu Yang

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.480
looks exactly like the Empress

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.540
when she was young.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.320
I thought

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.870
I had to kill her

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.480
to prevent the reincarnated Wu Zhao

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.790
from causing chaos
in the Tang Empire again.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.000
The concept of reincarnation
is merely a fantasy.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.120
How could you believe it?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.720
Besides,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.030
the Empress passed away 8 years ago,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.150
while Wu Yang is 17 this year.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.980
Her age doesn't match.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.850
I don't care about her age!

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.200
As long as she resembles the Empress,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.270
I want her dead!

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.510
At 9 AM,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.360
let's meet at the entrance
of the Chengfo Temple.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.840
Okay.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.810
See you tomorrow then.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.000
I watched for days

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.000
but never found an opportunity.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.150
Later I heard

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.270
that Wu Yang had disappeared.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:20.910
Officer,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.120

please let me go.

You seriously wounded my constable,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.910
which is already a crime.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.240
Moreover, because of rumors,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.960
you attempted to harm an innocent person,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.290
which is unforgivable.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.790
Take him away.

-Yes.
-Yes.

Wait.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.890
This isn't fair.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.960
I want to know

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.050
where I slipped up

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.660
so you could track me down.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.820
Well, well, you old fellow.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.670
You look about my age.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.320
You are a coal seller,

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.870
neither a fairy nor a beauty,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.600
so what are you doing with that

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.800

How did you know?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.460
Let me tell you,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.280
my nose was a gift from the immortals.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.840
It's all my fault.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.440
To investigate Wu Yang

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.870
without arousing suspicion,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.840
I went into that shop

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.000
and bought a box of Fairy Beauty Powder.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.060
Then I couldn't bear to throw it away.

no need to be so polite.

With your status,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.600
I don't deserve this.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.600
You were injured capturing a criminal.
That is honorable.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.790
You are a great hero.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.960
By Master Fei's order, I prepared medicine

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.910
for a hero.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.200

be considered a hero?

Of course.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.390
I've always felt

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.910
I don't look heroic enough.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.150
If I had five strands of long beard,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.870

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.480
wouldn't I look

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.000
a bit like Guan Yu?

Yes.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.640
Stick on a beard
and you'll look even more like him.

But whether you can meet the spirit

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.810
depends on your sincerity.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.290
Heaven and Earth can see my sincerity.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.350
Very well!

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.930
Then I'll use another method—

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.880
to channel the Empress's spirit

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.970
into my body

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.590
so she can speak to you.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.750
It's what people commonly call
spirit possession.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.420
Can you really do that?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.030
Of course.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.510
But this technique

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.680
will consume more of my vital energy.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
You must give me two more gold coins.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.740
As long as

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.570
you can help me

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.330
meet with the Empress in the spirit realm,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.920
I'll give you three.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.070
I am the Empress.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.400
Who are you?

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.030
It's me.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.270
It's me!

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.400
Mr. Shen.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.270
I am Mr. Shen!

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.110
Mr. Shen?

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.000
Empress,

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.320
don't you remember me?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.950
I served by your side for

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.740
more than 3 years.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.400
How could I not remember you?

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.550
When I showed you the slightest coldness,

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.030
you burned down Ming Hall.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.670
Why are you trying to kill me?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.160
Don't you worship the Empress

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.440
above all?

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.080
You fool!

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.270
You don't even know

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.720
who burned the Ming Hall,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.060
yet you dared to cheat me out of money.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.480
Go serve as a night watch in hell.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.670
There's blood on his hands.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.770
I just killed a chicken.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.830
A chicken.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.390
Take him down.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.230
In the end she lost her life

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.070
over money.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.720
Chenkong did it.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.920
No! Not my face!

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.030
Don't hit my face!

Official Lu,

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.770
aren't you going to stop this?

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.070
Stop it! Stop!

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.550
Let me.

Yingtao! Yingtao!

We need to interrogate him first.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.000
Let's interrogate him first.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.510
Why did you kill Ling, the night watch

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.710
of Shengye District?

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.280
She deserved it.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.720
Stupid as a pig.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.440
Xue Huaiyi was the one
who burned Ming Hall.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:41.460
My name is Shen Yu.

[Householder Chenkong]

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.700

[Shen Yu, Wu Zetian's Former Favorite]

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.790
but she used the Empress's name
to deceive me,

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.070
so I had to kill her.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.680
So you are Shen Yu?

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.720
I've heard a lot about you.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.200
I should never have lived in this world.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.110
Back then,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.680
among those

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.000
self-righteous scholars,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.590
my name was a disgrace.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.270
But I didn't care.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.770
The 3 years beside the Empress

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.270
were the best

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.000
of my life.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.550
It was you

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.750
who took Wu Yang

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.400
from the backyard of Yu Residence?

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.160
Now,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.720
where is she?

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.270
Is she alive?

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.710
I don't know where she is.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.590
This was found in your quarter.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.270
We've already had Wu Yang's mother
identify it.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.930
Are you still going to deny it?

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:41.720
Fake hermit!

I'll kill you!

I'll kill you!

We all understand how you feel.

But we're in the middle of questioning him

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.640
and the truth hasn't been revealed yet.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.720
You're yelling in court

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.160
and attempting to commit murder!

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.240

Let me go! Give me back Wu Yang!

Where is Wu Yang?

I truly don't know where Wu Yang is.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.360
Then how did this comb

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.750

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.240

where Wu Yang is.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.140
The first time I saw Wu Yang

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.850
was at Chengfo Temple.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.000
At that time,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.680
I had already decided to become a monk.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.920

[Great Buddha Hall]

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.760
Back then,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.200
I was summoned into the palace

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.160
as an imperial physician by the Empress.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:00.830
I couldn't see

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.090
the Empress every day.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.110
So the Empress

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.680
rewarded me
with a portrait of her younger self.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.830
I needed to look at it 1000 times a day.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.840
Wu Yang looks just like her.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.110
No,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.790
not just like her.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.420
She is the Empress herself.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.400
Later, because the two Zhangs
gained favor,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400
I left the palace.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.440
But my heart

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.480
never left the Empress.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.440
The year the Empress passed away,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.550
I came to Chang'an

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.310

at Chengfo Temple,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.240
because I wanted

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.400
to always be by her side.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.980
But unexpectedly,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.750
the Buddha granted my wish

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.610
and reunited me with the Empress.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.400
I immediately gave up my ordination.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400
I wanted to return

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.740

And Chi Ying was watching her closely,

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.620

by "send letters?"

Did Wu Yang ever write back to you?

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.520
Yes, she did.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.850
She said her mother

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.360
watched her too closely

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.320
and that she wanted to follow me

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.280
to wander through the landscapes
of the Tang Empire.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:48.480
I had

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.680
already won her heart,

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.110

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.750
I usually don't grow a beard,

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.480
because I'm afraid the Empress

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.740
wouldn't recognize me

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.720
in my dreams.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.590
I disguised myself as a hermit

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.120
just to get close to Wu Yang.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.880
I thought

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.730
I could explain everything

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.000
once we got familiar.

But

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.400
she wrote back

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:25.920
that she didn't want

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.830
any contact with someone

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.030
who had deceived her.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.200
No matter how I tried to explain,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.730
she refused to reply again.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.750
So,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.290
you kidnapped Wu Yang?

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.310
I...

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.960
I did think about it,

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.350
but before I could act,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.550
someone beat me to it.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.280

to the back garden of a residence,

to knock out the guards,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.160
and took Wu Yang away.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.030
So you know?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.920
Come, keep drinking.

I am Mr. Shen.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.220
Since your ascension,

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.970
I've been thinking of you day and night.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:54.550
Today,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.750
you're finally back.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.200
Insane.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:00.680
You're insane!

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.590
Has no one

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.680
ever told you
that you look like the Empress?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.810
Of course they have.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.920
That's been my biggest annoyance

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.720
for years.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.480
I thought your appearance

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.500
was destined.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.400
I didn't expect you
had ulterior motives too.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.160
I never want to see you again.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.720
Let me go,

or I'll report you to the authorities.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.130
She was so resolute.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:23.400
I thought

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.110
the only way to awaken her memories

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.840
of her past life was to bring her

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.370
before the giant Buddha built for her.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.110
What if she refused?

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.470
Then there was nothing I could do.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.910
No!

[Map of Chang'an City]

to stay inside the Buddha forever,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.480
the stone coffin
you carved behind the Buddha.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.030
Two months ago,

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.110
late at night at Chengfo Temple,

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.600
cries of a woman were suddenly heard.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.720
And you fabricated lies,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.860
claiming the Buddha appeared in your dream

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.680
and using dust and cobwebs

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.090
to trap the Subjugation of Devils,

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.030
all just to scare others away

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.070
from the Great Buddha Hall

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.240
so you could carve the stone coffin,
right?

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.830
What was that woman's crying

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.790
really about?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.200
Have you killed

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.160
other girls too?

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.350
You'll never know.

You're overconfident.

of Night-Wandering Ladies?

What's a Night-Wandering Lady?

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.510

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.510
said to be

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.200
transformed from deceased women
who died in childbirth.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.680
That's why they like
to secretly snatch babies

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.350
and often cry miserably

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.880
at night.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.400
Their cries sound like a woman weeping.

Yesterday, Yingtao saw a hole in the roof

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.070
of the Great Buddha Hall.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.510
Early this morning, she sent people

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.310
to set up a ladder to check it out,

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.310
and they immediately caught

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.510
5 or 6 of these Night-Wandering Ladies.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.680

This kind of bird

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.880
only roosts deep in the mountains.

Even if it flies into the city
during the day,

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.000
it always returns at night.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.350
But now it's nesting
in the Great Buddha Hall.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.590
Clearly,

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.480
someone did this on purpose.

These birds

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.280
fly at night and hide during the day.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.440
They love the dark and fear the light,

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.000
so once daylight comes,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.800
they stop crying.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.480
I see.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.710
That day I heard the cries,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.760
but the moment
Lu Lingfeng lit his fire striker,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.560
they stopped.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.920
That explains it.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.920
I remember now.

to gather herbs

always carry

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.070
a few of these strange birds with them.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.070
Back to the point.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.440
Where is Wu Yang?

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.110

carving behind the Buddha.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.590
Yes,

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.590
I wanted the Buddha's golden body

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.520
and Wu Yang's mortal body to merge,

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.920
so I could better summon

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:56.679
the Empress's soul.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.550
I also learned one thing.

The golden tablet that the Empress

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.840
had Taoist Hu Chao offer to the gods

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.840
atop Mount Song as atonement back then

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.630

So I hired a treasure hunter.

I thought that

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.480
once I obtained the golden tablet,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.630
I would hide it inside the Buddha as well.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.280
Then,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.050

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.330
Only this Buddha knows

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.200
where she is.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.590
Buddha, please bless her.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.650
Bless my daughter.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.110
Let her come home tonight.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.170
Bless my daughter.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.550
Let her come home tonight.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.750
Let her come home now.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.020
Bless my daughter.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.360
Let her come home tonight.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.560
Let her come home now.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.940
Bless my daughter.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.670
Chi Ying was praying

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.180
and Mr. Tao was asleep.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.150
Neither of them would leave.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.070
So I had no choice
but to blow out the candles

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.330
and try to scare them off using the birds.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.360
Bless my daughter.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.070
Buddha, please bless her.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:18.840
Bless my daughter.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840
Let her come home tonight.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.960
Let her come home now.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.420
Buddha, please bless her.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.110
Wu Yang!

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.760
Wu Yang!

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.480
But I failed.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.150
[Great Buddha Hall]

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.210
It wasn't until 3 AM

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.960
that I finally coaxed Chi Ying to leave

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.400
and drove Mr. Tao out of Chengfo Temple.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.710
Wu Yang,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.650
come on, look.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.670
This is the Buddha

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.000
I specially built for you.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.800
How do you like it?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.670
Do you remember who I am now?

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.110
Lunatic!

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.930
It seems the Empress's spirit within you

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.000
hasn't awakened yet.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.110
It doesn't matter.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.920
I can wait.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.050
How about this?

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.710
I'll take you to your hometown,

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.590
Wenshui in Bingzhou.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.150
There,

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.320
I'll make you

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.590
my empress, mine alone.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.150
Okay?

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:22.360
Dream on.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.480
If you don't agree,

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.410
I'll have no choice but to kill you.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.740
Death itself isn't frightening;

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.640
what's frightening

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.050
is being alive and being bound.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.740
In that moment,

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.030
I hesitated.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:56.920
She was so calm,

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.710
as if her heart

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.480
could hold mountains and rivers

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.000
and contain floods and beasts.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920
She truly is the Empress!

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:13.840
Tell me,

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.030
how could I bear to kill her?

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.150
It's you?

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.070
In a daze,

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.190
I saw someone

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.270
take Wu Yang away.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.550
I wanted to chase after him,

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.030
but I had no strength at all.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.630
Then,

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.070
I blacked out,

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.310
until this young lady

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:55.690
came into the Great Buddha Hall.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.320
[Law Before Power]

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.280
I blame myself
for not recognizing you sooner,

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.880
which let you keep doing evil

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.510
and killing Auntie Ling.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.500
There's another murder case—

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.630
Kuai Wu.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.020
He...

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.970
deserved to die even more!

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.480
He dared to publicly

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.680
slander the Empress!

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.430
I simply offered him a cup of wine

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.850
with a bit of poison in it.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.550
I didn't drink much today,

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.390
but why am I...

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.840
so terribly drunk?

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480
I did this with great satisfaction.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.390
From now on,

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.210
I'll kill whoever dares

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.880
to slander the Empress

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.200
without hesitation.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.480
Shen Yu, oh, Shen Yu,

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.550
You entered the palace
as an imperial physician.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.030
But now,

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.110
what you're doing is murder.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.710
You are simply a disgrace

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.110
to the word "physician!"

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:03.920
My face!

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.880
[Law Before Power]

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.280
Official Lu, Scholar Su.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.360
A female corpse
was found in the Ghost Market,

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.150
similar in age to Wu Yang.
