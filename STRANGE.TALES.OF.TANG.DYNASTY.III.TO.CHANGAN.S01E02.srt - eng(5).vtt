[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.900
[Episode 2]

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.729
Grand General.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.800
You're awake.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.950
Don't scratch it!

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.229
You have to tend it well.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.390
The wound will mend within ten days.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.759
You must be

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.370
the Miracle Doctor Fei who saved my life?

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.509
That's me.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.480
Jsut call me Master Ji.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.790
Or Benefactor, if you prefer.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.199
Go get Lu Lingfeng.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.360
Fei.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.250
Here's the wine I got for you.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.840
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.590
You're back just in time.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.120
He's asking for you inside.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.890
The Grand General is awake!

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.180
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.540
Grand General.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.760
Rest assured,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.329
no matter when

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.280
or what injustice I suffer,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.170
I, Lu Lingfeng,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.030
will never harbor any personal grudge

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.230
against His Majesty.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.120
Because my heart

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.450
remains loyal to the Tang Empire.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.280
Good.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.280
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.770
Prepare the horses.
Follow me to the palace.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.120
You can't ride a horse yet.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.750
I must see His Majesty immediately

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.780
to recommend you as my successor.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.730
Grand General!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.260
I must see the Emperor.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.470
From today on,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.220
you will be the Grand General
of the Right Imperial Guards.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.280
Fei!

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.790
Master Ji!

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.420
-General.
-General.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.000
Fei!

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.800
Don't move me!

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.120
My ribs

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.830
and my leg bones

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.560
are broken in at least four places.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.480
Be gentle.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.190
In this world,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.000
the only person who can set his own bones

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.000
is none other than me, Fei Yingjun.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.390
Fei, stop bragging.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.550
Look how exhausted Miss Xijun is.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.190
Xijun is clever
and has medicine knowledge.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.520
She learns quickly.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.850
Otherwise,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.280
I, Master Ji, would be finished.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.270
You saved my life.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.160
I should repay you.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.310
Xijun,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.630
open my right hand.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.020
A feather from the raptor?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.350
Master Ji,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.690
in that moment of danger,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.890
you still thought to pluck its feather?

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.950
That's called staying calm in a crisis.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.430
Or not leaving empty-handed,
if you prefer.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.830
Even if I fell to my death,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.780
I had to grab at least one feather.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.030
Give it to Lu Lingfeng

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.950
so he can identify what bird it was.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.350
He will surely thank you.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.160
Doctor Fei.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.450
Lu Lingfeng.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.870
A feather Master Ji plucked

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.070
from the raptor's body.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.930
Keep it for now.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.240
How are his injuries?

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.120
Don't worry.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.630
He won't die.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.560
You saved me this time.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.070
Thank you.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.130
No need to thank me.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.870
Since you're not going to die,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.670
let me ask you.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.480
What is this?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.360
Last night,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.580
I saw three golden peaches

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.060
rolling on the ground.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.990
I thought

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.000
since you were with His Majesty,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.430
you must have eaten some already.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.510
I got these three myself,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.510
and I'm the oldest,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.250
so it's not too much to have one myself,
right?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.159
The Kang Kingdom's golden peach,

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.480
truly worthy of being a tribute.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.240
Wonderful!

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.190
Wonderful!

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.510
The remaining two

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.290
can be shared among the four of them.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.010
Isn't that fair?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.850
But you didn't leave any for us!

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.160
Blame it on

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.110
the golden peach's divine taste.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.600
It...

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.330
It was luring me at every turn.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.130
These three golden peaches

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.430
were actually rewards
that I requested from His Majesty

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.840
for all of you.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.870
You ate them all by yourself

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.240
and then blame the peaches?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.600
You...

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.070
Enough.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.360
Though Master Ji is greedy,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.170
he has already been punished.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.020
Don't blame him anymore.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.290
They've all had the peaches.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.230
What's wrong?

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.159
Thank you for reminding me, Xijun.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.250
You want to use my palace token?

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.159
I must go to the palace immediately

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:59.220
to see His Majesty.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.430
Yes.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.540
The Imperial Guards

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.270
cannot go a day without the Grand General.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.130
Bring me paper.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.980
I'll write a blood letter
recommending you.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.840
Grand General,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.250
that's not why I'm here.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.720
Then why?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.330
The golden peaches from the Kang Kingdom.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.240
What?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.780
That evil bird has entered Chang'an?

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.630
Is the Grand General alright?

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.240
This time, the raptor

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.669
did not attack the Grand General.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.409
Instead, it targeted

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.030
Fei Yingjun, who was treating
the Grand General's wounds.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.549
Whether it's Your Majesty,
the Grand General, or Fei,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.630
before being attacked,

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.429
they all had one thing in common.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.500
They had just eaten the golden peach.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.390
You mean...

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.320
That bird

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.920
only attacks people
who have just eaten the golden peaches?

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.240
Although it's just a guess,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.640
I humbly beg Your Majesty

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.330
not to eat any golden peaches.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.600
Could it be

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.320
that Your Majesty has just eaten some?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.120
No, I haven't.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.890
However, as per custom,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.510
tributes from foreign kingdoms

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.730
have already been distributed
to the Retired Emperor,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.990
the Grand Princess...

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.790
As well as various nobles and relatives,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.460
and meritorious ministers.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.440
I respectfully urge Your Majesty
to act swiftly.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.230
Recall all the golden peaches immediately.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.020
I will personally meet the Retired Emperor

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.820
to explain the situation to him.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.650
Your Highness.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.530
Do you know

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.600
[Retired Emperor]

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.080
when I first tasted

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.380
these golden peaches,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.240
how old was I?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.660
I was two years old.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.360
That year, Liu Rengui

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.920
annihilated the Wa Kingdom

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.280
at Baijiangkou

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.750
in Baekji.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.960
Emperor Gaozong

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.220
held a grand fruit banquet to celebrate.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.510
It just so happened

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.640
that the Tang envoys
returning from the Western Regions

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.040
brought back a few golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.280
Father placed one peach

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.430
in my hands.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.270
But at that time,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.410
I didn't have all my teeth yet.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.690
How could I bite it?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.170
Father said,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.560
"The people of Wa

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.890
fear strength,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.670
not virtue.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.240
This war

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.270
showed the might of the Tang Empire.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.130
Even if you cannot bite it,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.420
you must suck its juice fiercely.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.080
As a royal child,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.960
you should celebrate with the empire."

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.750
So I did as told.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.790
Guess what happened?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.480
Emperor Gaozong

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.270
said I showed promise,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.320
and that someday

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.390
he would pass the throne to me.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.840
Decades have passed.

My son, please rise.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.810
I heard from Su Wuming

that your journey to the West
was fraught with danger.

You must have suffered greatly.

of a greater importance.

I must implore Your Highness

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.240
not to eat these golden peaches.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.030

Although you're also Master Di's disciple,

when it comes to investigation skills,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.390
you're still no match for Su Wuming.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.390
Do you know why?

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.800
Because you're too honest,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.840
naive,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.510

Eating this golden peach

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.260
will attract raptors.

How is that possible?

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.110
This must be someone

close to His Majesty

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.510
who made this up just to trick you.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.770
Your Highness,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:14.850

in the back garden.

It's not that I didn't try,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.140
but there was no need.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.080
Lu Lingfeng has already rushed

to the Princess's Mansion to inform them.

Lu Lingfeng must have warned her in time,

the golden peaches.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.700
No.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.340
Good. Prepare the horses.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:10.960
Yes.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.700
dropped three times,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.590
and then disemboweled
by that vicious bird.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.520
It was horrific.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.170
Any news on Aunt?

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.640
I heard Her Highness

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.830
held a golden peach banquet
in the back garden.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.400
Even the guards

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.880
were rewarded with tribute peaches
and wine.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.140
But except for Cen Zhi,

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.240
no one was attacked.

Where did Cen Zhi die?

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.880
Not far from here.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.810

The situation has been extremely tense
lately.

I ordered him to report any news
immediately.

Kill me then.

This proves

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.480
that this vicious bird

is kept by the Princess's Mansion.

If the Princess's Mansion
can hold a golden peach banquet,

it means they don't suspect
the golden peaches.

Hunger strike?

He had bitten several guards,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.270
so we had to put him in a cage.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.000
Only then did he calm down a bit.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.680
Liu XVIII, however,
focused on reforming himself.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.960
He's also clever and diligent,

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.400
so we let him

He went mad

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.270
I didn't mean to do it.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.310
Despair has taken control of you.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.150
And you dare to call yourself a scholar.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.360
When Master Di was wrongfully imprisoned,

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.000
his life was hanging by a thread

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.430
but he never gave up.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.110
With his intelligence

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.480
and his desire to live,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.310
he finally walked out of prison

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.740
and returned to court.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.590
He even planned ahead

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.360
and saved the Tang Empire

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.010
five years after his death.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.680

Repeat the last sentence

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.070

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.350
That's not just empty words.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.000
So your brother can hear.

Only by staying alive

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.550
can you live better.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.000
Continue.

Only by staying alive

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.590
can you live better.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.640
Only by staying alive

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.270
can you live better.

can you live better.

they're still placed in a coffin
for burial.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.070
This is a new policy in Gantang County.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.110
That's right.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.350
When I first took office,

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.030
I wanted to introduce new practices.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.830
This Liu XVII

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.570
is the first one.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.880
Giving every deceased person the dignity
they deserve.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.750
This is a good initiative.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:01.690
Sheriff Xu,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.590
please accept my respects.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:09.880
Everyone,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.170
who is willing to join me

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.480
to open this coffin?

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.830
I'll do it.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.600
This is truly bizarre.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.720
Where's the head?

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.960
That's what I should ask you.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.890
What's going on?

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.440
I...

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.830
At that time, after the executioner

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.160
cut off Liu XVII's head,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.840
I personally put it together

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.790
with his body into the coffin.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.510
Mr. Su,

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.070
you insisted on opening the coffin.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.870
Did you already know about this?

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.810
May I ask for your surname?

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.640
My surname is Ma.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.550
Mr. Ma,

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.760
Liu XVII's head is missing.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.110
And you're the one who did it.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:17.880
Confess now,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.360
or else I'll cut

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.159
your head off.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.230
How...

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.880
How could I possibly have done it?

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.840
Just now when Mr. Su and Sheriff Xu

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.320
were opening the coffin together,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.230
from your position,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.889
you couldn't even see
if there was a head inside.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.710
Could you possibly have foreseen this?

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.440
So it was really you who did it?

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.320
I trusted you so much

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.070
and entrusted you

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.020
with all the burial arrangements.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.590
For what purpose
did you steal the criminal's head?

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:56.590
Tell me the truth.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.720
I had gambling debts I couldn't repay.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.320
So I sold Liu XVII's head

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.190
to a yin-yang merchant.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.230
A yin-yang merchant.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.000
Oh, lady.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.230
My wife is quite a good dancer.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.770
But this face...

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.800
If my wife looked like this,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.840
why would I ever come to a tavern?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.230
How about bring this face home

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.920
and swap it with your wife's?

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.110
What...

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.640
What do you mean?

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.070
Exactly what I said.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.110
[Yin-yang Merchant, Ever-changing Master]

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.510
Three gold ingots

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.030
and that face is yours.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.710
Who is it?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.260
I didn't make any appointments tonight.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.500
Coming!

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.670
Which gentleman is it?

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.210
Didn't even make an appointment in prior.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.240
Oh, you.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.440
You've become quite clever,

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.900
even learned how to knock.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.840
Recently in the capital, there's a saying

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.640
going around,

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.070
saying that the current Emperor

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.320
is not the Retired Emperor's
legitimate eldest son.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.510
He cannot sustain the Tang Empire.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.110
Did you spread these rumours?

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.550
This time, it truly wasn't me.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.190
It's because the news of him

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.450
not being able to enjoy

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.150
the golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom leaked.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.590
This is the will of the people.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.170
Speaking of which,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.630
I want to eat golden peaches again.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.290
Guards!

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.800
Cut some peaches

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.130
to go with fine wine.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.080
Chancellor Cui and I shall drink together.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:23.960
Yes.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.820
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.880
However,

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.800
regarding the position
of the Grand General

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.460
of the Right Imperial Guards,

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.030
the few candidates that we recommended

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.840
were all rejected by the Retired Emperor.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.070
It must be His Majesty's interference.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.380
It doesn't matter.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.630
Even if Lu Tong

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.920
doesn't give up his position
as the Grand General,

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.670
he's already a broken man.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:56.180
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.370
Grand General.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.800
What merit do I have

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.820
to have Your Majesty
visiting me in person.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.400
There's no need

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.630
for such formalities between us.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.360
Please rise.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.590
Your wounds...

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.590
They're much better now.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.050
Please sit, Your Majesty.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.480
Your timing is perfect, Your Majesty.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.110
I

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.570
have something to report.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:23.800
Speak.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.360
I am crippled now.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.320
The position of Grand General
of the Right Imperial Guards

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.920
is beyond my capability now.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.490
After much consideration,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.160
only Lu Lingfeng
can take on this responsibility.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.560
I know you value talent.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.070
As do I.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.320
But Lu Lingfeng's

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.360
primary task now

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.130
is to stay here and protect you,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.960
in case that evil bird returns.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.030
Your Majesty, that bird...

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.670
That bird

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.400
did attack the Grand General's residence.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.760
The truth remains unclear.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.000
We must remain vigilant.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.660
But the Right Imperial Guards

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.070
cannot be without a commander.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.800
You cannot give up your position
as the Grand General.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.670
If you do,

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.650
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.070
Since Lu Lingfeng has merit
in protecting you,

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.840
could he be restored
to his former position?

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.480
With the rank of Middle Commander,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.140
he could temporarily lead
the Imperial Guards.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:19.880
I

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.850
truly cannot lead troops at this moment.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.640
That's not a problem.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.320
General of Loyalty and Valor, Li Feng,

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.590
can temporarily take command

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.880
until you recover.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.140
Grand General,

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.880
please focus on your recovery.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.440
Li Feng will not disappoint

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.100
His Majesty's expectations.
