00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.240
Father.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.070
Father.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.120
Father!

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.790
Father, I know my mistake.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.400
Father!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.480
I know my mistake.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.600
I know my mistake.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.610
From now on, I will listen
to everything you say.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.560
Father.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.070
Father.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.790
Father.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.220
What are you thinking about?

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.240
The Prince suddenly committed suicide
at this time.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.430
I find it a bit strange.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.590
It's not strange that he died.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.550
But the timing of his death
was just right.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.860
You also think there's something
suspicious about this.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.280
After all, we didn't see the scene.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
Do you think

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.800
that Feng Zhengxin would die so easily?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.870
Anyway, I don't believe it.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.590
What you hear may be false,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.750
but what you see is true.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.290
Tomorrow, there will be a funeral.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.390
Many people will definitely go
to attend the funeral.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.870
I'm thinking

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.960
we could take this opportunity
to go and find out the truth.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.460
(Memorial)

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.660
(Memorial Tablet of Prince Chong Feng Zhengxin)

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.270
Your Highness,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.170
please accept my condolences.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.040
Do you come here

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.950
to laugh at me?

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.720
That is not the case.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160
You misunderstand us.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.310
Xu Wanning,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.750
do you know

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.870
what I hate the most right now
is seeing you

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.680
with that smug, self-satisfied look.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.720
You brought Pei Heng here today,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.240
just to tell me

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.830
that you are a winner

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.480
and to see how miserable I've become
because of you.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.270
Because of me?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.430
Xu Wanning,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.390
everything I had was taken away by you.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.560
My lover, my family.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.590
Why?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.360
You are a scheming and flirtatious woman.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.920
You always oppose me in everything.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.160
Everything I had was ruined by you. Why?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.510
Because I can tell truth from lies;

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.830
I can distinguish good from evil;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.870
I understand human nature;

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.440
I have never asked anything from others;

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.240
I only trust myself;

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.830
I don't believe in fate;

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.950
Everything I want, I fight for myself;

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.870
I will take responsibility

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.750
for the mistakes I made myself.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.750
You bandit, bandit!

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.240
You shameless person!

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.520
Your Highness,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.040
ask yourself honestly.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.990
Which of your family members
or loved ones

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.390
have I taken away?

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.950
You reap

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.190
what you sow.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950
Now you have tasted this bitter fruit.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.040
Shouldn't you reflect

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.600
on what you have done?

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.360
Madman! You bunch of madmen!

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.830
Someone! Drive them out!

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.680
I'd like to see who dares.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.480
If you don't take action today,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.680
it will be you who die.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.830
Do it!

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.910
Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.910
Brother.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.560
Xiaoxiao,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.240
my uncle's spirit in heaven

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.040
also hopes to walk the final journey
in peace.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.510
Many thanks to you for being here.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.080
The time has come.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.800
Let's get started.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.660
(Virtue and Diligence)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.900
What a pity.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:13.060
(Memorial Tablet of Prince Chong Feng Zhengxin)

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.000
The incense is fine.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.270
Your Majesty.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.320
Ash.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.670
The ash is poisonous.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.720
Xu Wanning, oh Xu Wanning,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.270
you've finally fallen into my hands.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.950
Yu've ruined my plans time and again.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.430
Let's see how I torment you today.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.920
Uncle,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.720
you… let her go.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.150
Your Majesty.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.480
All of your people have been
under my control.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.490
What right do you have
to negotiate terms with me?

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.040
Nephew, it's a pity I didn't die, huh?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.430
I thought you had met with disaster

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.870
and I felt very sad.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.870
Felt very sad?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.040
Your act is quite convincing.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.040
I don't know why my brother chose you
to be the Emperor.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.890
You have no talent
for governing the country.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.750
You are timid and cowardly by nature,

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.220
clinging to life and afraid of death.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.190
Otherwise,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.390
let me take your place
and firmly hold this realm.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.600
What do you think?

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.120
Uncle, you intend to kill me?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.240
Kill you?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.200
Kill you.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.550
Little nephew,

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.200
have you forgotten
this throne rightfully belongs to me?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.630
It was your father who snatched it
from my hands.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.390
For this very moment,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.080
I have waited for 30 years.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.720
30 years.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.550
Today, this funeral

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.870
is prepared for all of you.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.240
I will kill you.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.960
Kill every single one of you.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.790
Make you accompany me in death
for these 30 years.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.180
Jinlin Guards, where are you?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.080
How is that possible?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.670
The trap I set is flawless.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.390
How could you possibly know?

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.720
The trap you set is flawless.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.870
But Hongzhen Incense betrayed you.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.790
(Hongzhen Incense?)

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.870
When it reaches a certain concentration,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.770
it can make a person unconscious
for three days,

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.030
without a trace of life.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.720
But it comes alive when it meets fire.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.840
You added oiled paper into this brazier.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.480
The flames will disperse
the concentration of the Incense.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.120
So when the time comes,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.510
you will wake up.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.550
But all the guests present
will slowly be poisoned,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.630
and gradually die.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.390
Killing two birds with one stone.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.550
What a clever scheme!

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.720
It was you who tampered with this room

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.030
and saved everyone's lives.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.360
That's right.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.270
I applied medicine here in advance.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.730
So everyone is not actually poisoned.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.330
They just fell asleep for a short while.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.390
Now they should be about to wake up.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.910
Xu Wanning, it's you again.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.750
Father.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.120
I'll fight you to the end.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.320
Do you know that the Emperor
you've been protecting all along

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.550
is actually the one
who most wants you dead?

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.670
You are disabled because...

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.960
Uncle, go to the underworld

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.480
and accompany my father.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.550
He must miss you very much.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.240
Father!

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.030
Father!

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.750
It's fake.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.080
It's all fake.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.240
Master.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.690
Master.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.320
What's wrong, Ruyi?

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.910
Master, Aunt Ning and Chang'an have left.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.870
They are gone.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.150
What?

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.960
They really left.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.680
♪Carrying away the sorrow of farewells♪

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.520
♪I linger alone in the snow♪

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.760
♪Waiting for a fate
that will never come♪
