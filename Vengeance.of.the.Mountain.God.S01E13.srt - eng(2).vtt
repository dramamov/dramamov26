00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.480
That one from the Jin family,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.680
you're not worthy of this plaque.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.040
Boss Wu,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.600
can't you handle losing?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.160
Boss Wu, do you have something to say?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.480
That Jin brat,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.720
isn't worthy of this plaque.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480
Boss Wu,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.160
calm down.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.600
The prized ginseng decides the winner.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.120
It's a rule passed down by our Ginseng Guild founder.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.760
So Ginseng Guild members must follow the code.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.560
Winning or losing isn't shameful.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.280
As soon as that Jin brat showed up,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.040
he caused chaos at the Lin family's banquet.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.160
Not long after,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.920
the Lin father and son met their end.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.600
What I can't figure out is,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.240
all of the Lin family's assets

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.440
ended up under the Jin family's control.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.640
Isn't this murder for profit?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.280
Doesn't this break the Guild Code?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.160
Yeah, how could this happen?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.480
The Guild Code is clear:

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.080
if any member commits murder or theft,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.320
it's a grave betrayal.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.840
Punishable by death.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.080
Boss Jin,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.760
maybe there's some misunderstanding here.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.760
Why not explain things to everyone?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.440
Clear your name.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.920
I have nothing to say.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080
A life for a life.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.720
The Lin father and son died mysteriously.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.640
This Jin kid

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.520
must give everyone an explanation.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.600
Right, yes, that's right.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120
Give us an explanation, give us one!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.800
The Guild Code won't tolerate him.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.920
The Lord of the Mountain won't tolerate him either.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.200
Years ago, the Jin family angered the Lord of the Mountain.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.480
Because of that, all these years

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.760
we've never found any big ginseng roots.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
Now the Jin heir wants to join the Ginseng Guild.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.400
He'll anger the Lord of the Mountain again.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.560
He might drag our whole Ginseng Guild,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.840
every last one of us, down with him.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.720
Duan Jiuye,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.360
we can't keep that Jin brat here.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.040
He can't stay, he mustn't stay.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.000
He mustn't stay.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920
He mustn't stay.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.040
Back then, Lin Wancheng tried to kill my brother Jin Zi.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.840
He disgraced and drove his sister to her death.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.040
None of you said a word.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.840
Now you talk about the Guild Code.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.760
You've twisted every word to suit yourselves.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.480
Young man,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.400
watch what you say.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.640
The Lord of the Mountain punished the Jin family back then.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.200
Now, anyone who helps the Jin family

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.120
will anger the Lord of the Mountain.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.640
The fate of the Jin family's remnant is none of our concern.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.760
Duan Jiuye,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.400
don't bother with him.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.480
Someone,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.360
take him away.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.680
I'd like to see who dares.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.200
Boss Jin is a benefactor to the Yang family.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.920
Within this Ginseng Guild,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.840
anyone who dares touch Boss Jin

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.040
must get the Yang family's approval first.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.200
Fine.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.920
So the Jin family

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.640
wants to go against our entire Ginseng Guild?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.200
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.920
That's how I see it.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.640
Elders,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.360
you always bring up the Lord of the Mountain's wrath

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.120
every chance you get.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.640
But think about it,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.400
if the Lord of the Mountain truly rejected the Jin family,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.640
why did he bless Boss Jin

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.560
to find the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.760
Is it really the Lord of the Mountain who can't accept the Jin family,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.400
or is it you who can't accept him?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.000
Young Master Yang

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.200
Young Master Yang

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.360
Young Master Yang

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.360
Young Master Yang

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.760
What's going on?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.640
Something big happened.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.480
It's serious.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.640
Why are you panicking?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.920
Just tell me.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.040
Something major happened at the Ginseng King Gathering.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400
All the ginseng shops in town know.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Jin Shisan found the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng, right?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.400
Are you a sage or something?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.920
You even knew that?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.040
Either say something useful,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560
or go get me another pot of wine.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.280
No, that's not it.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.920
So you know about your second miss too?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480
My sister?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.360
She probably dug up some big worthless ginseng.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.280
Seems she's more capable than her brother.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.200
So, what happened?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.680
Who won?

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.400
Was it the Yangs or the Jins?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.760
Your second miss showed up with worthless ginseng.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.200
The Yang family lost a lot of face this time.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.960
What?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.800
I'm not finished yet.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.360
The Ginseng Guild wants to settle the Lin family's murder.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.840
They all want Jin Shisan dead.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.240
And take the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.280
Yang family's second miss tried to protect Jin Shisan.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.040
She used the Yang family name

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.960
and became enemies with the whole Ginseng Guild.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.960
You, you—

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.840
Your clothes—

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.280
What are you doing?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.800
We're all family here.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.800
The Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng appeared.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.520
That's a day worth celebrating.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.640
Let's all calm down.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080
No need to get so worked up.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.280
Boss Jin,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.680
just tell everyone exactly what happened.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.920
What really went on?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.680
About the death of Lin Qiye's whole family,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.280
and how you took over the Lin family's assets.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.080
If none of this is true,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.840
let's have a drink and call it even.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.240
We'll wipe the slate clean.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.480
But if you did kill them,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.400
I'll have to follow the Guild Code.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.800
You'll be beaten to death.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.520
And the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng goes to the guild.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.400
What does everyone think?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.480
Duan Jiuye is fair

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.560
and makes clear judgments.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.520
That's reasonable.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.920
Of course I'm being framed.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.920
But I have no proof.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.400
None of you believe me.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.520
How about this—

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.120
I'll leave the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng with the guild for now.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.680
In three days,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.480
I'll find

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.080
evidence that convinces everyone.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.960
That's straightforward.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.640
But what if you can't produce it then?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.520
The ginseng goes to the guild.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.280
And you can do as you wish with me.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.400
Then, in front of our founder,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.680
it's a deal.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.960
It's a deal.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.680
It's a deal, it's a deal, it's a deal.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.520
Look over there.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.480
It's pitch black.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.800
Must be the bandits' lair.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.960
Let me go and kill them.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.960
I'll wipe them out completely.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.200
Alright, alright.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.680
Have some tea to soothe your throat, Jiuye.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.120
Jiuye.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.800
Your methods are still the sharpest.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.960
You won't let go of the Lin family case.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.080
Jin Shisan will never recover now.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.400
Jiuye is like an old spirit in our northern woods,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.040
a thousand-year-old monkey turned wise.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.080
That little Jin brat,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.360
no matter how he jumps, can't become wise.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.840
He can't escape Jiuye's mystical power.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.520
Wu, have some tea too.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.840
If you can't speak well, don't speak.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.680
Don't flatter and end up embarrassing yourself.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080
I—uh—

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.920
Wu,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.040
Sit, sit.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.400
Eunhee, you don't know this—

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.240
Wu never went to school.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.480
He doesn't play mind games.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.760
But he's truly loyal to me.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.960
You two are both dear to me.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.840
Jiuye.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.680
This time, the Divine Dragon's Twin-Incense Ginseng is in the guild's vault.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.560
Which means it's in your pocket, Jiuye.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.200
In three days, Jin Shisan will be executed.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.040
Then the Nine Immortals' Compass will be yours too.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.200
That's the first thing.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.040
Watch Jin Shisan closely for the next three days.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.680
Don't give him any chance to turn things around.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.800
And the second thing—

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.240
In three days, the guild will put Jin Shisan on trial.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.960
Use this chance to storm the Jin family.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.360
Seize the Nine Immortals' Compass.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.360
Don't let it slip away like three years ago.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.520
Like how the Lin family got away.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.240
Follow Jiuye's orders.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.640
By the way—

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.680
The Yangs want to protect Jin.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.120
Should we let them?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.120
The Yang family's second miss isn't in charge.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.040
Yang Baye isn't opposing the whole town.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.160
He doesn't have the guts for that.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.120
No need to worry.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.360
Dad

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.240
You can't just let my sister

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.480
keep acting out like this.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.560
She even took a worthless ginseng

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.920
to the Ginseng King Gathering and embarrassed us.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.920
And now, look at this—

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.120
she's angered everyone in the Ginseng Guild

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.560
just to back Jin Shisan.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.480
She’s dragging our Yang family into this mess.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.480
Now the whole town is laughing at us.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.480
How can our Yang Ginseng Shop

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.040
ever survive in Songling Town after this?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.240
Dad,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.920
please, say something!

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.920
I'm done.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.320
You need to make a decision.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.600
If you’re done, get out.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:36.920
Wait—

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.680
Dad,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.360
this—

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:38.920
Get out!

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.120
Why?

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.880
I'm this sick,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.680
I can't deal with you and Duan Jiuye’s nonsense.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.040
All those petty problems.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.240
Just because I ignore it doesn't mean I don't know.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.120
Back then, Duan Jiuye and I dug for ginseng

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.120
risking our lives in the mountains.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.120
That’s how we built this family business.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.560
You little brat,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.480
you’ve ruined my reputation.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.360
Get out!

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.360
I'm back.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.120
Got yelled at again.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.480
Dad,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.800
look what treasure I brought you.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.480
Nice.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.720
Phoenix’s Single Tear turned into a worthless ginseng.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.560
Keep your wealth hidden.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.920
No one will target our Yang family.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.360
My child,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.880
you’re thoughtful.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.320
It’s all thanks to your father’s teaching.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.880
Brother Jinzi,

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.920
Brother Jinzi,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.560
I—I—

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.800
What are you doing?

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.360
Can’t you see?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:02.920
Chopping wood.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.320
Making a fire to cook.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.920
We only have three days left.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.240
Hurry and find some evidence.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.120
Otherwise, the two of us

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.560
will get eaten alive by them.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.720
I can't help it either.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.360
Besides,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.240
Old Lin really died right in front of us.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:17.680
Is it dirty or not?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.320
Is it dirty or not?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.040
Brother,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.560
You shouldn’t say things like that.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.480
Walls have ears.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.920
What if someone overhears?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.360
Got it!

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.800
Tonight,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.120
we’re having braised ribs.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.720
Darn it.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.440
We agreed to work a few more days.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.240
You work a few more days, then find someone else.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.680
Why are you—

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.720
There’s no future following you guys.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.480
Kicking me when I’m down.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.120
What’s wrong?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.040
It’s only been a day or two,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.800
and rumors about you are all over town.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.680
Good thing you didn’t go to the Ginseng King Gathering.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.040
It was way too dangerous.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.240
Blood was spilled at the slightest move.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.120
If you’d gone with your small frame,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120
you’d be gone in a snap.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.800
I’d have to look after you too.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.600
Is this really the time for jokes?

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.160
All you’re good at is talking.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.600
Where’s Brother Shisan?

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.480
The three-day deadline is almost up.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.240
He’s just been sitting there.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.040
Brother Luo is missing again.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.440
I’m the only one worrying.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.360
It’s like the emperor’s calm but the eunuch’s panicking.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.480
No way.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.360
I’ll go ask Sister Ruyi for advice.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.240
Report to Steward Cui.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.920
Jin Shisan is still the same.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.800
What is he plotting?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.560
Keep watching him.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.560
Report back anytime.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.560
Yes.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.600
Where is he?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.560
No idea.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.880
Can’t see from your side either?

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.480
Who is it?

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.680
It’s late at night.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.040
Can’t people get some sleep?

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.800
Haiyue.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.800
Haiyue.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.560
Miss Yang the Second.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.360
Keep your voice down.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.320
We’re here to save you.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.680
You won’t survive the Ginseng Guild meeting tomorrow.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.040
Haiyue and I have already come up with a plan for you.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.920
Come with us, quick.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.920
Change your clothes first.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.240
What are you doing?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.040
Where are we going?

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.240
Wait—

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.720
What are you two up to at this hour?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.360
My family happens to have business with Korea.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.360
You two will disguise yourselves as ginseng buyers.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.000
Blend in with our trade caravan.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.880
Once you reach Korea,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.600
I’ve arranged for someone to meet you at the post station.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.120
You’ll quietly leave the caravan.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120
Then hide out in Pyongyang.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.800
I can’t leave.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.360
Right.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.480
I won’t leave either.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.240
At the very least,

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.800
we should steal back the Divine Dragon’s Twin-Incense Ginseng.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.360
Brother Jin risked his life for it.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.800
We can’t just let them have it.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.880
Foolish.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.240
Baobao,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.000
You’ll go but never come back alive.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.600
Miss Yang the Second,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.000
I appreciate you and Haiyue’s kindness.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.680
But I can’t leave.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.480
My father’s murder

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360
is a hatred that cannot coexist.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.480
Our ancestors left us teachings.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.360
We must follow them.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.240
Honor the Lord of the Mountain.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.880
Blessings to all.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.800
Greed and anger cloud judgment.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.360
Heaven and earth will not allow it.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.160
Jin Shisan.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.800
I'll give you one more chance.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.600
Were you behind the Lin family's massacre?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
No comment.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.800
You promised everyone in the Guild.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.560
To show proof in three days.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.120
Do you have it today?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.040
No.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:34.960
Kill! Kill! Kill!
