00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.400
Want it

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.320
This fills you up, but it's not good

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.720
You don't know shit

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.400
This is good stuff, we all eat it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.360
This ginseng is thick at the top, thin at the bottom

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.680
Look at its lines and grooves

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.200
And its ginseng roots

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160
This is cultivated ginseng

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.680
It's worthless

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
You can tell ginseng apart

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.800
Where are you from

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.000
Me

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.840
I... I used to help my parents

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.000
Worked odd jobs at a ginseng shop

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.240
So I know a bit

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.560
But this is just cultivated ginseng

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.520
It can't nourish blood

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.160
What's the point of knowing that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.280
Knowing this

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.280
Can save your life

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.720
Save your life

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.960
Boss, you're here

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.600
Boss, the batch you wanted

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.920
I've raised them all for you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.640
I followed your orders strictly

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.120
Fed these blood slaves plenty of premium ginseng

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.200
Take a look

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.920
There's a very special one here

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.240
It's top quality

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.240
About the final payment

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.960
Can you pay a bit more, right

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.520
Boss, may I speak with you privately

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.920
May I speak with you privately

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.920
Come

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.920
Please tell the financier for me

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.840
Let him rest assured

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320
His ritual

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.280
Will go smoothly, no problems

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.560
Yes, yes, yes

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.760
Pull it out and take a look

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.640
This specimen is really good

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.720
Let's stick to the old rules

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.640
Pay first, check the goods after, okay

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.720
Uh, uh

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.280
You don't know the rules

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360
Don't know the rules

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.080
Since you don't know the rules

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.360
Then you can't leave

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.280
Leave the money

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.920
Or leave your life

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.560
Three

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.480
Two

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.080
One

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.200
Shoot

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.720
Don't let him get away

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.920
Hurry, go

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.840
Go, go, stop looking, hurry

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.920
Don't run, don't run

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.640
Stop! Where are you running

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.080
Still trying to run

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.280
Go

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.040
Push hard

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.040
Come on

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.480
We're not out of danger yet

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.840
We need to hurry

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.440
Brother, sorry about this

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.040
Actually, when I first saw you

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.320
I knew you were that Jin Shisan kid

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.360
Do you know me

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.280
Qiao San'er, I'll kill you

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.600
Kid, you're tough to kill

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.040
The debt I mentioned

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.760
Was about the Lin family's eldest son

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.040
Since I saved you

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.040
You should do a good deed to the end

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.040
Repay my debt with your life

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.160
Take the money and go

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.480
Thank you, Third Master

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.320
You're holding it pretty tight

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.600
Who dares take anyone's money

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320
It's your turn

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.160
I heard your eyes

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.040
One's black, one's green

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.160
If I dig out the green one

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480
Will it still be green

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.360
Wait

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.600
Aren't you after money

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.440
Instead of taking my eyes

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280
Why not use my eyes

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.040
To show you a way to fortune

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.880
Dozens of boxes of premium ginseng

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.720
You know their value

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.480
No need to explain

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.360
Even if you follow Lin Wancheng all your life

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.040
You'd never touch them

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.760
Just don't know

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.600
If you have the guts to take them

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.280
Give me some

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.440
Eat, eat

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.000
Come

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.160
Go

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.040
Is it here

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.280
Go

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.160
We're here

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.440
See it

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.840
It's on that table

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.600
Take as much as you can carry

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.720
At this time

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.760
The traffickers should be

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.600
Drinking at the tavern to the east

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.480
You can act now

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.320
Qiao San'er

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.200
The warehouse is guarded on all sides

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.960
Only one exit at the back

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.240
Leads straight to Changbai Shan's southwest

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.000
If I die

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.640
Who'll get you out

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.000
So you planned it all

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.520
Go

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.000
You guys, open it and check

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.880
Come here, come here

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.560
Okay

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.000
Go, that way

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.440
You guys, grab those over there

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.320
Thief! Thief!

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.440
Thief! Thief!

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.200
What's going on, thief!

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.120
Don't kill me

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.880
Thank you

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.000
No need to thank me

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.120
I should thank you

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.640
How did you know

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.760
Bro

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.560
This warehouse has so many windows

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.120
You spoke near mine on purpose

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.800
So I'd hear you, right

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.880
Your trick lured them in and used others to kill

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.760
Brilliant

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.320
Without your midnight warning

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
This wouldn't have worked

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.000
Same to you

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.200
I have to save someone

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.560
Hurry, go, go

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560
Can't let them escape

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.320
Chase them

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.800
Chase

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.560
Follow

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.640
Don't let him run, catch him, go

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.680
Go, go, go

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:34.800
Bro,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.320
I can't run anymore.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.760
Unless the King of Hell takes me away,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.560
no one can make me take another step.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.320
Where do we go next?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.800
Follow this road and we'll reach Black Dragon River.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200
Then we'll get out of the mountains.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.680
Let's go.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.680
Bro,

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.560
Leave me, just go.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.680
What are you saying?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.880
If it weren't for you,

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.440
I'd have been drained dry as a blood slave.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.440
From now on, my life is yours.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.200
Go.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.960
Jin Shisan.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.440
Interesting.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.160
You're exactly who I'm looking for.
