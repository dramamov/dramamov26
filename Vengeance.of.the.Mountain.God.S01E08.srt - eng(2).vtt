00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.840
Brother

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.760
You're back.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.040
Dinner's ready.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440
Jin Shisan is back.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.040
You've grown taller.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.040
You rascal, always out and about—

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.200
What are you showing off for outside?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840
You never come home to practice your skills.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.760
Enough, come eat now.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
Eat up, brother.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.440
Come eat, child.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.240
I'm calling you—come eat!

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.160
Come here.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.800
Are you spaced out?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.760
Hurry, it's still hot.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.120
What are you doing?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.520
I'm calling you—come eat!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.200
Come here.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.400
Come eat now.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.440
Come on, don't just stand there—eat!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.200
This kid...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.680
Come on, come here, brother.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.400
Time to eat.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.200
I'm back.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.640
Jin family

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.760
Ancestors above,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.040
Three years ago,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.640
My father, Jin Buhuan,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.680
led our kin to the mountain to honor the spirits.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.680
He was betrayed by villains.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.480
Our whole clan was slaughtered.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.120
Only Jin Shisan survived.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
Jin Shisan has lived in hiding for years.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560
I dared not seek death.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.760
Only to return to the Ginseng Expedition today.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.040
To uncover the truth.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.200
For my father,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.840
for my whole clan,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.400
to avenge our blood.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.840
Restore

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.280
Jin Ginseng House.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.480
Ancestors, I beg you

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.960
for guidance and protection.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.680
Miss Yang, you really like watching
people from the shadows.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.080
But right now, you're the one
hiding in the dark.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.800
I, Yang Ruyi, always speak and act
with honesty and integrity.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.360
Honest people don't speak in riddles.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.080
Fine.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.480
Then let's be direct and speak openly.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.760
Miss Yang, what brings you here?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.120
I just wanted to ask you something.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.920
That day in the woods—

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.080
Why did you shield me from that arrow?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.800
Miss Yang, you misunderstood.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.240
No.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.640
I blocked it for you.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.080
But I didn't want you to block it for me.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.240
That arrow was meant for me.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.520
So you're in a dangerous position now.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.560
You hold the Divine Disk now.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.960
All the ginseng clans

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.240
will be watching you like hawks.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.800
So your Yang family

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.960
became the first to try and seize the Divine Disk.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.960
My brother was just used as a pawn.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.760
And what about you?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.360
I want to form an alliance with you.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.920
My brother uses force,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280
while I use words.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.920
If we can't take it, we win you over.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.640
No wonder you're called Yang Ruyi.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.080
Your Yang family's schemes

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.560
have reached all the way to my Jin family shrine.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.040
Fine.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.040
Since Boss Jin isn't interested,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.480
just pretend I was never here.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.360
Goodbye.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.800
I don't wish to be your enemy.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.800
But we can't be friends either.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.920
I wonder what Brother Shisan

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.920
is talking about with Sister Ruyi inside.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.360
They've been talking for so long.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.240
What are you mumbling about?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.200
Reciting scriptures.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.800
Scriptures?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.120
What scriptures are you reciting?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.680
The Classic of Mountains and Seas.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.840
Cui—

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.920
Haiyue.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.120
Can you teach me some Ginseng Expedition rules?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.040
In a few days,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.680
I'll join Brother Jin on the Ginseng Expedition.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.040
I don't want to hold him back.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.800
You think you can just call her Haiyue?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.520
Go on, get out of here.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.480
Go play somewhere else.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.680
Look at my sister Haiyue—

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.360
she's adorable even when she's angry.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.640
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.680
So young, yet already a Hunt Master.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.200
That's top status in the Changbai ginseng clan.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.200
Way better than Yang Ruyi.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.080
Don't say that about Sister Ruyi.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.120
She once dug up a Six-Petiole Wild Ginseng.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.480
So what?

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.360
We'll just dig up an even higher-grade ginseng.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.840
Haiyue.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.920
You're so skilled—

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.040
teach me, will you?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.240
Alright.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.560
Let me explain it to you.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.360
First of all,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.760
when starting a Ginseng Expedition,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.120
you must pick an auspicious day.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.640
A team can be big or small,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.360
but the Hunt Master decides who joins.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.680
The Hunt Master

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.200
is the lead stick of the team.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.760
Mainly responsible for scouting and finding ginseng.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280
The others

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.200
line up in a row behind.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.040
The one behind the Hunt Master is the waist stick.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.400
They help the lead stick cover any gaps.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.520
After finding ginseng,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.400
it's mainly their job

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.240
to dig it up with the lead stick's help.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.960
Those beside the waist stick are the side sticks.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.080
They search the edges for ginseng

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.360
and handle the team's safety.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.120
They guard against sudden attacks by beasts or snakes.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.480
I can do that job!

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.680
You?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.040
Oh, right—

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.240
there's one more role.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.080
The helper.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.960
They handle all the logistics.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.240
I'm not doing that.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.360
Haiyue, protect me!

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.360
Brother Shisan.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.040
Tomorrow is the Ginseng Expedition Gathering.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.360
We still have a lot to prepare.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.120
Jin—

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.920
I found two shotguns in the backyard.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.800
Both were used by your father.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.560
This one's a German twelve-shot.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.240
And this one—

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.680
your father bought it from the Russians, a repeating rifle.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.480
This Ginseng Expedition is risky.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.240
Let's bring them all.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.360
Brother Luo—

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.360
Ginseng hunters can't say unlucky things.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.360
We must say we'll turn misfortune to fortune.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.240
Great luck and prosperity.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.120
Darn, my big mouth.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.600
Turn misfortune to fortune, great luck and prosperity.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.240
Turn misfortune to fortune, great luck and prosperity.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.560
Turn misfortune to fortune, great luck and prosperity.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.800
Great luck and prosperity.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.360
Great luck and prosperity.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.680
That old Duan Jiu—

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.360
I feel sick just seeing him now.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.360
I've had enough of days like this.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.040
I followed him when I was still a young woman.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.560
And in the end—

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.120
the old man never gave me anything real.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.360
He owns dozens of ginseng houses,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.240
but won't let me touch any business.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.680
Why are you getting angry as you talk?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.240
You...

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.560
Just wait a little longer.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.920
Once I take over the Yang family,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.560
you won't have to serve Duan Jiu anymore.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.680
But I really can't wait any longer.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.560
At this Ginseng Expedition Gathering,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.920
if we dig up the Ginseng King,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.120
we'll leave and start a new life.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
Ginseng King...

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.360
That's easier said than done.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.120
We can't count on the Jin family.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.120
Only if Yang and Duan join forces

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.360
I'll go persuade Old Duan Jiu.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.120
This time,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.920
we can only rely on your sister, Yang Ruyi,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.800
to compete with Jin Shisan.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.000
Alright.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We'll do as you say.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.880
Okay?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.360
Jin Shisan

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.360
Is this The Nine Immortals' Compass?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800
Can I take a look at it?

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.240
You're Cui Haiyue's younger sister, right?

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680
My name is Cui Enxi.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.240
Just call me Enxi from now on.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.360
Miss Enxi, is there something you need?

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.120
Jin Shisan

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.680
You're really in the spotlight now.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.560
Your future looks bright.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.680
And you manage such a big family business.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.800
You must need a capable assistant.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800
By your side, right?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.120
Is this Cui Haiyue's idea?

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.440
Of course not.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.040
My sister is honest but naive.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.360
She wouldn't think of this.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.800
Besides,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.800
my sister's personality

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.480
is easy to be manipulated.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.680
She gets pushed around.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.360
Father made her Hunt Master

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.120
just because she's the eldest.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360
And I'm the youngest.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.120
But if you talk about skill and brains,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.160
I'm better than her.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.240
You and Cui Haiyue are nothing alike.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.240
Jin Shisan

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.800
I'm just a blunt person.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.680
Don't take it personally.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.560
I think the people around you,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.680
like Chief Luo,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.040
and that Yan... Bao guy,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.680
aren't cut out for business.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.360
One's a bandit.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.560
The other acts like a fool.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.920
My sister told me

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.800
you rescued him from some blood slave den.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.680
You saved him.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.560
No parents, no family.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.120
Well,

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.160
Chief Luo and Bao

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.000
are my brothers through thick and thin.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.480
Cui Haiyue saved my life.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.120
Miss Enxi,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.000
look,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.000
our Jin Ginseng House isn't big.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.240
Just this small courtyard.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.680
Three or four people.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800
It's already crowded.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920
And lively enough.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.360
If you have nothing else,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.480
please head back.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.680
Darn it, kindness wasted.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.680
We'll see.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.560
Enxi.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.360
Sis.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.040
When did you get here?

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.120
I already greeted Jin Shisan.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.560
More than just a greeting.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.360
They're all useless.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.680
Not one is worth mentioning.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.040
Useless? What do you mean?

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.360
Who are you talking about? Me?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.120
I don't really get what you mean.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.480
Sis, can't you see?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.920
That Divine Serpent Gallbladder

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.480
was wasted for nothing.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.680
That Jin guy just wants to take advantage of us.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.560
He doesn't plan to give us anything.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.680
Enxi.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.240
I never thought about

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.800
benefits or losses.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.920
That gallbladder

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.320
was found by Jin Shisan's father

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.120
and our father during a Ginseng Expedition.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.160
Our father survived the Divine Serpent

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.680
thanks to Old Jin, the Hunt Master.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.800
The Jin family helped our father.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.240
They helped our Cui family.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.360
Cui Haiyue,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.800
I'm your real sister.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800
You won't speak up for me,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.680
but you help outsiders.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.360
Enxi.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.680
Do you remember what our father said

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.120
right before he died?

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.560
Always put morality

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.920
before personal gain.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920
Morality, morality...

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.920
You all talk about morality.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.800
But in the end,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.680
father was still hounded to death by creditors.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240
Fine, Cui Haiyue.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.680
Hold on to your morality

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.120
and stay with these useless people.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.240
Enxi.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.120
Move aside.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.360
Haiyue, your cooking is amazing.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360
You could open a restaurant.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.000
Even eating can't shut you up.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.680
Jinzi.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.120
Everything's almost packed.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.920
You're the Hunt Master.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.120
Assign everyone their tasks.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:38.800
Alright.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.360
I'll take the lead stick.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120
For the middle stick,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.680
Haiyue,

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.480
you take it.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.560
You have more experience.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.800
Uncle Luo,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.560
you and Bao take the side sticks.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.560
One left, one right.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.120
Jin Shisan

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.800
Have you decided where we'll start tomorrow?

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.600
Gale Pass.
