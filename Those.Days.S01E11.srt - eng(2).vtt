=Those Days=

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.800
(Adapted from iceread.com novel
"You Xi" by Qingyang Wanxi)

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
=Episode 11=

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.960
The daughter we sent away

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.310
hasn't been brought back yet.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.950
Don't offend the daughters we have
at home.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.110
Son,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.640
tell Bichen,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.880
that once she marries in,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.160
I'll treat her

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.670
like my own daughter.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.080
Okay, Mom.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.030
Then when will you and Dad

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.470
Bichen's parents

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.960
to discuss the wedding?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.600
Don't look at me.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.110
You're the one

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.440
who makes decisions.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.560
What?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.580
Well.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
Why are you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.780
suddenly quiet when I ask?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.820
No, I'm not avoiding anything.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.180
I'm just... Thinking.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.780
Well...

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.820
Here's what I think.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.980
Tell Bichen

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.980
to go talk

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.740
to her parents first.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.820
See what requests they have.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.580
Then we'll know where we stand.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820
Right? If we meet them unprepared

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.660
and we can't agree on anything,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.140
then

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.180
there's no room to negotiate.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.580
Right?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.340
That makes sense.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.580
I'll talk to Bichen.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.900
Good.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.340
Xiang.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.860
What?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.820
Listen.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.660
What's wrong?

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.940
What's with all the waving? Enough.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.460
Have more.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.020
What requests do we have?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.300
Bichen,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.460
did Xu Zhidong ask you to feel us out?

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.380
How can you call it that?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.840
Getting married
isn't a business negotiation.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.420
Two families becoming one.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.540
That's basically
like starting a company.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.060
Chen,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.740
our only request is

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.740
that Zhidong treats you well.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.060
That's the same as having no request.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.500
Sometimes a single "well"

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.260
can weigh a ton,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.420
sometimes it feels lighter
than a feather.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.560
If he treats you well today,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.300
what if he stops treating
you well tomorrow?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.380
Mom, I know him.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.580
He won't.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.780
Bichen,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.140
do you know why marriage is called
an important life event?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.500
Because it turns

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.340
two people with no blood relation

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.100
into immediate family.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.700
You're binding your lives together.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.420
Isn't that difficult?

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.820
It is.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.140
Exactly because it's difficult,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.420
that's why weddings are made big.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.100
Once you're married,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.980
both families pour in all they've got.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.470
The bride and groom both take the plunge

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.520
like they're sitting for
the college entrance exam.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.540
Who wants to take
the exam two or three times?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.220
Marriage is the same,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.940
right?

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.460
When you two have conflicts

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.340
or life gets hard,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.020
you'll think back to
how much effort the wedding took,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.460
and you'll endure it.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.140
Your mom is right.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.420
How do I tell Zhidong?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.540
Xu Zhidong's family is working class.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.820
If we ask for too much,
they can't afford it.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.420
We'll set the bride price
at 200,000 yuan.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.380
Tell him that. Is that okay?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.220
200,000?

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.340
Where are we supposed to get that?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.140
Oh my.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.740
Ask Zhixia.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.780
Ask Zhixia?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.300
Is she an ATM?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.660
Ask Zhixia, you say?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.900
Does she owe us

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.060
money?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.420
Our loafers

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.100
are very comfortable to wear.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.860
Yes. You can tell just by looking.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.620
This gray looks better on you.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.020
I also think the light color
looks nicer.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.860
But

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.140
black doesn't show dirt.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.140
It must be black, right?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.460
If it gets dirty, you can wipe it.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.660
But if the gray gets dirty,
you'd have to buy another pair.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.260
So troublesome.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.340
Any discount for this pair?

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.020
This is a new arrival, so no discount.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.940
No stores offer discounts on new items.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.220
Right? Have you ever seen a store
just came out with discount?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.100
Stop talking.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.260
Do you know how much it is?

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.420
You're joking around.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.540
How expensive can it be?

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.940
I'm pregnant,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.500
so it's hard

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.180
to try on shoes right now.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.380
You can buy another pair later.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.780
You know what?

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.460
Our shoes are really comfortable.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.660
Have you tried this brand?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.580
I have.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.180
I'm a regular customer.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.900
Why is it taking you so long

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.020
to buy shoes?

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.060
6,800?

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.500
That's robbery.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.100
You...

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.540
Sorry about that. I'll keep looking.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.420
We'll walk around.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.260
Sure.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.620
If you need anything, come find me.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.620
I'm Amy.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.460
I'm Peter.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.940
What Peter?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.780
What's wrong with you?

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.860
You come shopping

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.020
and you don't know the price,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.420
yet you talk nonsense.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.900
I know I'm poor.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.950
I can't afford it, but I can at least
try them on. Trying is free.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.780
I was joking earlier.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.740
If you like them, we'll buy them.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.580
Let's go.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.580
It's not that we can't afford them.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.850
Don't even think about buying it.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.100
The thought of stepping on

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.260
a whole stack of money,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.460
I feel like I'm disrespecting them.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.620
What if we switch it to coins?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.550
Would that feel better?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.540
Hello. I have an appointment with Sam.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.540
My surname is Xu.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.220
Sure. I'll take you over.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.860
This way, please, Miss Xu.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.700
Alright.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.540
Please wait here, Miss Xu.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.820
Sure. Thank you.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.060
Miss Xu.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.140
Sam.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.540
Please sit.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.980
Nice to meet you, Sam.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.220
We'd like to participate

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.100
in the autumn promotion
of Castilla lipsticks.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.340
This is a proposal from our team.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.060
Please have a look when you have time.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.900
Sure.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.500
Everyone in our company

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.100
is a loyal client.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.420
We're huge fans.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.180
Really?

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.020
Yeah.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.500
When I told my team

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.020
we were competing for

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.260
a partnership with Castilla,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.340
they all got excited.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.980
My assistant is a big fan
of your mousse series.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.340
The shades are smooth and classy,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.820
and the price is really affordable.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.140
Sorry, Miss Li.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.380
My surname is Xu.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.260
Miss Xu,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.660
I have a call meeting soon.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.700
I'll look at this later, okay?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.940
Of course.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.940
I won't keep you.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.500
My contact is on the last page.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.380
If you have any questions,
feel free to contact me.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:04.900
Okay?

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.740
Okay.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.760
- Looking forward to working together.
- Bye.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.140
Bye.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.140
Dear,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.540
don't forget the prenatal class today.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.020
This is my second child.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.180
What could I possibly not know?

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.620
I should be teaching them instead.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.140
Didn't you choose the People's Hospital?

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.140
It's mandatory. You can't skip.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.380
Alright.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.340
I'm already on the way.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.380
I'll meet you at the hospital
after I eat.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.620
No need.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.340
Just focus on
your application materials.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.180
If you become the department head,
that's the best support for me.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.300
Alright.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.700
I'm hanging up. I'm driving.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.420
Drive slowly.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.060
Hao.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.780
Nobody's here.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.340
You're eating a lot, Hao.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.020
Where do you think this belly comes from?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.620
Hao.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.700
I saw the notice.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.700
You're applying for the promotion too?

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.100
My wife forced me. No choice.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.300
It's a good thing.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.980
Hao,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.540
can I tell you something?

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.620
I'm applying too.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.580
And

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.860
my wife insists

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.980
I must get the position.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.140
I'm under a lot of pressure.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.500
Raise your arms from your sides
as you breathe in.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.820
Slowly look up.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.220
As you breathe out,

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.340
lower both hands slowly down
along the two sides.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.900
Lower your head slowly.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.540
Raise your arms from your sides
as you breathe in.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.140
Slowly look up.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.260
As you breathe out,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.150
lower both hands slowly down along
the two sides. Lower your head slowly.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.940
Mr. Lu.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.380
Lift and lengthen your back again.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.020
The publicity didn't have much effect?

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.460
Very well. Slowly turn your head back.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.700
Slowly lower both arms

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.820
to your sides.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.340
Again, breathe in.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.340
Raise your arms from your sides.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.580
Well, Mr. Lu.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.060
Our plan

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.900
has three phases.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.540
We need a warm-up period.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:26.860
Right hand down.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.820
Yes, that's right.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.780
Don't worry.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.660
Our whole team is fully committed.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.540
Let your arms lead your body up slowly.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.380
Okay. Sure.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.500
Call me anytime.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.660
Bye.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.980
Right arm.
Bring your right arm to your side.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.820
Left arm reaches out diagonally.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.540
Hello, Maodou.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.620
Relax your chest muscles,
underarms, and upper arms.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.460
Mr. Lu just called.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.350
He said the publicity
didn't have much effect.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.540
Breathe out.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.740
I'm not expecting you
to write some genius post.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.100
You just need to

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.580
do one thing.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.980
Get all your aunties

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.860
to call the factory of Rufeng Liquor.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.420
Yes.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.260
Just say they saw it
from Zhixia's public account

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.780
and came to inquire.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.500
Ask how much

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.300
the liquor costs,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.500
where to buy it,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.940
and if there are discounts, whatever.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.060
Left hand goes behind the body,
right hand rests on the right knee.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.020
Alright, I'm counting on you.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.380
- Bye-bye.
- Keep your back lengthened.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.300
Breathe out. Turn back.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:25.820
Breathe in.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.860
Lift your arms and body,
and return to center.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.140
Breathe out. Turn to the right side.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.780
Mingzhu,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.980
you work at Nanxi Hotel, right?

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.340
Switch sides. Twist.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.180
Why?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.980
Do you know Rufeng Liquor?

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.620
It's of very good quality.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.980
Breathe in again. Arms up.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.380
Interlace the fingers.
Palms turn upward.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.660
Look toward your hands.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.980
When you breathe out.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.820
Can you

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.980
help me ask

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.300
how to get the liquor
into Nanxi Hotel's sales channels?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.020
I'm currently on leave.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.060
And I don't handle
the food and beverage department.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.780
You should call and ask.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.580
Underarm and upper arms.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.220
Breathe out.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.500
Alright. Everyone, lie on your side
and come up.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.940
Let's take a break.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.180
Are you all right?

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.020
Good work.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.020
Slowly.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.740
Did I fall asleep?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.180
Mingzhu.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.660
I'm on leave now.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.980
And the food and beverage department
isn't under me.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.220
It's not that.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.900
Come here.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.140
Have some plain yogurt. No additives.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.100
Thank you.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.740
I still have some.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.140
I'm sorry about last time.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.580
I was in a bad mood.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.860
I talked a bit harshly.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.620
- Please don't take it to heart.
- Did you?

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.140
I don't remember.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.100
I'm already in my thirties.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.460
The older I get,
the more I realize life isn't easy.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.140
There are things

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.140
you can't tell right or wrong.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.100
I don't know

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.500
if you can accept me saying this.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.860
My mom...

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.860
She feels too guilty.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.340
Please don't blame her.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.860
I won't.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.140
When I was a kid,
my mom always taught me

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.740
not to live holding onto resentment.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.140
The cake is really good.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.180
Jiao loves it.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.020
It's soft.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.260
Get a bite.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.140
Jiao plays piano very well.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.060
She has a solid foundation.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.940
Of course.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.460
Her first teacher
was really hard to get.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.860
I begged him for days

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.060
before he agreed to take Jiao.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.740
I sit in on Jiao's lessons

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.380
and take notes.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.620
After class, we practice piano together
at home.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.140
I didn't even know

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.620
what a staff is.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.020
Now, I could probably pass

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.820
music theory level 8,
do you believe that?

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.100
I can definitely pass the exam.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.500
You really are a devoted mom.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.860
Then why did you ask me to teach Jiao?

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.740
You could do it yourself.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.860
Well, I wanted to get closer to you.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.780
Thanks to your encouragement,

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.780
she practices on her own now.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.780
She's always saying,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.220
"Miss Shen said

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.180
I'm gifted."

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.860
Kids need to be praised.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.840
The more you encourage them,
the more confident they get.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.740
Zhixia,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.900
is raising a child expensive these days?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.140
It depends on how you raise them.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.780
If the baby is breastfed,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.900
that doesn't cost anything.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.820
As for diapers,

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.860
if you use the big packs,
maybe three or four packs a month.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.740
Clothes you can buy online.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.860
Those aren't too expensive.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.700
Around two thousand a month.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.060
The real money goes into

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.950
early education classes,
after-school lessons,

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.100
and all those amusement park
membership cards.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.460
Mothers are willing

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.820
to spend on everything

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.460
their children like.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.780
I did the math.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.180
If I give birth naturally,
the medical insurance covers most of it.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.380
So it won't cost much.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.180
But I haven't been sleeping well lately.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.850
I'm worried I won't have enough
breast milk after the baby is born,

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.340
and I'll need to buy formula.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.380
Your in-laws are well-off.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.220
That kind of expense is nothing to them.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.860
It's kind if they help.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.820
I'm the child's mother.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.620
So I still need to budget carefully.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.580
My turn.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.020
I'd like you to check

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.900
my investment account.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.940
Here's my ID card.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.820
When does it mature?

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.580
Sure. I'll check them for you.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.340
It matures on the 20th of next month.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.860
Next month?

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.580
Next month...

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.260
Can I withdraw it

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.020
this month?

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.620
You can,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.700
but your earnings will be reduced.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.340
Your principal will be affected too.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.300
The principal too?

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.020
I see.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.220
Could you please check

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.620
the balance in this account?

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.460
Sure.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.180
You have 3,000 yuan in your balance.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.380
Would you like to withdraw it?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.540
No, no.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.500
Three thousand plus that.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.540
- Madam?
- Plus that.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.980
Madam?

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.700
Do you need any other services?

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.860
No, I'm done.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.620
There are other customers waiting.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.820
Sure. I'm so sorry.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.620
Okay. Thank you.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.035
A woman carries a baby for ten months
and gives birth in one day.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.460
Pregnancy isn't easy

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.060
for mothers.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.260
I hope the soon-to-be fathers

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.420
can feel what it is like for them.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.700
Now,

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.500
can our soon-to-be fathers
say something from the heart

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.420
to their wives?

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.140
Who wants to start?

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.540
Sure. Please.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.660
Mingzhu,

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.740
this session is kind of boring.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.980
Let's go.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.740
Zhixia, you're a second-time mom.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.770
You've got experience.
It's up to you to listen or not.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.860
I can't leave.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.540
There'll be more moments like this
in the future.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.820
I need to get used to it.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.380
Dear,

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.940
do you remember

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.900
the first time we found out
you were pregnant?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.300
We hardly slept,

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.860
right?

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.900
We kept thinking about

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.740
what to name the baby,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.380
what kind of education to give them,

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.380
and what school to pick.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.260
Give the baby a proper name.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.620
I've got it in mind.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.460
If it's a boy,

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.700
we'll name him Xiangru.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.060
If it's a girl, we'll name her Yimo.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.660
This third wheel...

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.780
Once this third wheel

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.900
comes between us,

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.820
I'll never let them
put you through anything.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.620
I promise

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.460
I'll put you before the baby.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.140
You'd better keep your word. Hear me?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.380
Who's up next?

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:21.730
Me.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.980
Dear,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.820
for the sake of the baby,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.460
you've sacrificed your slim figure,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.340
your favorite hotpot,

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.260
and endured ten months of pregnancy.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.220
(Baby, Mommy loves you.)

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.980
(Daddy loves you too.)

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.700
Mom, we're back.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.340
You're home.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.180
Yes.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.740
What are you doing?

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.340
Nothing.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.940
What happened to your foot?

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.140
It's bleeding.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.780
It's fine. A plaster will fix it.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.500
Let's put a plaster on.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.420
I'll be fine soon.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.820
Does it hurt?

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.260
A little.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.620
Mom,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.500
why does my heart hurt
when your foot hurts?

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.140
Because you were born from me.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.620
Mothers and daughters
are connected at heart.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.940
Jiao,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.540
I understand Grandma now.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.060
What's it?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.150
That mothers and daughters
are connected at heart.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.140
Hey,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.260
look at these shoes.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.820
They suit pregnant women perfectly.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.780
They have rubber soles, non-slip.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.060
The fabric is soft.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:08.900
Try them.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.020
They're really soft.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.700
Right?

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.300
- They won't come apart, will they?
- No. Don't worry.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.580
What about the sizes?

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.860
All sizes are available.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.060
38, 39, and 40.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.260
Which size do you want?

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.780
Get one pair in each of three sizes.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.940
One pair each?

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.860
Okay.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.780
You're such a good husband.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.940
Your wife's really lucky.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.100
Of course.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.780
Three pairs?

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.660
Same styles?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.500
Different sizes.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.900
This pair is for now.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.740
This pair is for five
or six months pregnant.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.920
This pair is for right before
the baby comes.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.140
They're not expensive,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.220
but they solve your problem completely.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.020
The materials are good and comfortable.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.420
They're non-slip. Look.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.340
Right?

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.580
See?

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.060
I can even put them on.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.660
Is it too big?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.060
It's okay.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.340
Keep them.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.020
Jiao can wear them

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.180
when she grows up.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.940
Right. Pass them down.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.540
I'll try this on.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.460
Turnip cabbage and spiced beef.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.460
Both you and Mingzhu have them.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.220
You can't complain this time.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.700
I'm here.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.060
I'm here.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.700
I'm here.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.380
Alright, stop staring.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.900
Your eyes are about to fall out.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.060
I feel like everyone on the street

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.740
is happier than I am.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.340
How are you going to be a mom
with that in your mind?

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.860
Might as well not have this baby.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.580
Did I make the right decision?

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.700
The baby will grow up

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.820
without a dad,
while other kids have one.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.260
Won't they blame me?

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.380
I don't have a dad either.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.820
My dad's still alive,

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.900
but he's dead in my mom's heart.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.420
Listen.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.940
Once you've made a decision,

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.620
don't keep tearing yourself apart
and doubt it.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.460
You can't live like a victim forever.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.540
The baby isn't born yet,

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.560
and you're already worried

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.900
they'll blame you.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.540
You can blame them too.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.660
If it wasn't for this little thing,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.140
you could start over

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.380
and have another kid with a dad,

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.220
right?

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.980
Speaking of which,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.780
let's say

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.980
you have a child with a dad.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.860
What if he goes out to sleep around,

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.700
take drugs, or hit you?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.460
It's better not to have a dad at all.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.220
Clean and simple.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.060
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.420
Are you writing a drama?

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.620
Did I get on your nerves, Ni Dani?

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.020
Not that.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.140
I'm jealous of you.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.100
Jianqi is gone,

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.300
but

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.780
your adoptive parents

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.180
and biological parents are doing well,

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.420
and your in-laws are rich.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.420
Alright.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.180
You comforted me.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.260
Sorry.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.460
I haven't seen those shoes before.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.860
My mother-in-law gave them to me.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.780
I knew it.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.020
They're so expensive.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.700
I can't even bring myself
to buy the knockoff.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.140
Forget it. I don't want anything now.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.860
I just want Jianqi to be alive.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.530
The whole world revolves around you.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.140
You want something, and you get it.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.900
Jianqi is gone. That's a fact.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.940
But you have a baby,

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.060
two sets of parents,

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.220
in-laws,

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.300
money, a house,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.860
and me.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.020
That's also a fact.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.940
If you don't want to rely on
your parents,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.140
you can rely on me.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.380
Are you touched?

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.620
Deeply touched?

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.340
Shouldn't you be hugging me and crying?

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.460
Get out.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.100
I don't need to rely on you.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.420
I'm going back to work tomorrow.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.060
That's more like it.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.460
You're going to be a mom.
Making money is the real business.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:49.860
Cheers.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.380
Wishing you all the best.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.100
Six hundred more.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.620
Two more.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.780
Mom, what are you doing?

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.060
Another five hundred.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.460
I'm calculating

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.660
how much it costs to raise a child.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.780
It's expensive.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.980
Six hundred.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.060
Five hundred.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.020
You can't raise a child like this.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.780
Kids shouldn't be raised too delicately.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.460
It doesn't cost much.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.660
Look at Xiaoni.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.340
She's smart.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.540
Her family didn't spend
that much at all.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.140
She bumped her head the other day

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.380
and got two stitches.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.140
How much was it after insurance?

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.940
Thirty-something.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.340
Exactly. Cheap, right?

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.220
Ni's mom has a cat.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.660
One shot costs over five hundred.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.660
Raising a kid is cheaper
than raising a pet these days.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.300
Raising a kid is expensive, anyway.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.820
Don't worry.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.780
Even if the Feng family
doesn't help you, you have us,

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.060
right?

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.540
We have money.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.020
Your task right now

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.820
is to take care of your body

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.060
and give me a healthy baby,

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:13.900
that's all.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.340
Dad and you have raised me.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.140
I'll raise my own child.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.900
Come.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.540
Alright. Hurry up and drink.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.820
Drink the milk before it gets cold.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.420
Come on.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.860
Alright. Your other hand.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.100
(Nanxi Hotel)

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.380
Mingzhu.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.500
Mingzhu, you're here.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.660
You look good, Mingzhu.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.620
Thank you. I'll head in first.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.460
Sure.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:57.980
Mingzhu.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.300
- Mingzhu.
- Why are you here?

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.050
Are you here to extend
your medical leave?

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.500
No, I'm here to work.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.540
- Work?
- Work?

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.300
Is Sam here?

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.700
He's not in today.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.860
He's out visiting clients.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.780
When will he be back?

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.820
I can wait.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.700
It's hard to say.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.660
Maybe you can make an appointment
on his WeChat.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.580
Sam,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.660
I saw your car in the parking lot.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.980
If you won't see me,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.060
I'll wait here.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.260
If you see me and turn me down,

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.980
I'll leave right away

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.180
and won't bother you again.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.940
Hi.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.500
Have a seat.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.700
Come on.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.500
Do you really want me to be honest?

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.380
We think
you don't have the class for this.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.740
All your posts on your public account
are trivial family stuff.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.420
They just come off cheap.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.980
They don't match our brand image.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.100
With due respect,
why would high-end consumers

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.500
buy a 58-yuan lipstick?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.740
That's our business.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.900
I'll be honest with you.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.980
Your product isn't going to sell well.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.620
Don't you want to hear
a real opinion from an ordinary woman?

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.620
To write this proposal,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.860
I bought every shade
of Castilla lipstick.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.220
I tried them one by one

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.100
and realized your product positioning
is wrong.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.020
From packaging to marketing,

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.660
your target customers

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.340
are young girls.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.380
Preferably, active users

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.420
on social media

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.660
who'll buy

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.860
and then write good reviews for you.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.780
Mr. Sam,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.380
young buyers aren't loyal.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.660
From a 58-yuan Castilla lipstick
to a Chanel that costs a few hundred,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.740
there are hundreds of competitors
in between.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.740
You devote yourself to them,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.580
and they can dump you any minute.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.620
Continue.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.940
Please do not give up
on women at our age.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.260
Middle-aged women have parents
to take care of, children to raise,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.260
and work to juggle with.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.980
We're willing to spend thousands

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.280
to buy spirulina for our parents,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.180
and we'll pay thousands
on piano lessons for our kids.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.820
But we hesitate to spend on ourselves.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.300
Do we not want to look pretty?

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.420
We do. Very much.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.580
But we have to think about money.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.140
Castilla's lipsticks
have a full shade range,

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.500
and they go on smoothly.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.700
For the price of one luxury brand,

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.820
you can buy half a dozen of these.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.380
Perfect for treating ourselves.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.180
Take me, for example. I'm pregnant with
my second child. My feet are swollen.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.780
Buying brand-name shoes

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.860
really hurts.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.020
But with these,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.460
I can buy three pairs at once

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.340
and wear them all the way
until I give birth.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.660
Isn't that great?

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.580
Miss Xu,

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.740
I respect your courage,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.700
and I'm happy...

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.100
Sam, let's be real.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.900
How about this?

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.620
Give me a chance.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.860
I guarantee my public account

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.460
will sell at least ten thousand

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.060
Castilla lipsticks.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.540
If I don't, I won't take a dime.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.860
But if I do,

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.580
I want a 30 per cent promotion fee.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.500
Okay. Deal.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.300
Mr. Zhao.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.420
Mingzhu.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.020
You're in good shape.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.540
Yes.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.350
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.740
You've been standing all day

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.300
as the lobby manager.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.720
I'm thinking of transferring you
to the food and beverage department.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.700
All you'll need to do is take calls

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.900
and handle reservations.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.780
Much easier.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.580
But that department
runs its own accounts.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.100
The pay is much lower.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.380
You still care about that?

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.580
Of course I do.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.060
I have a child to raise.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.620
That's true.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.740
But Mr. Feng...

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.660
- He...
- Mr. Zhao.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.020
It's better to rely on myself.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.820
Alright then.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.300
Stay where you are.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.860
When you really feel like
you can't stand anymore,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.700
we'll talk again.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.860
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.300
Mr. Zhao,

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.340
there's something I want to ask you.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.060
Go ahead.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.620
I have a sister

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.620
who promotes Rufeng Liquor.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.300
Could that liquor enter our restaurant?

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.980
The entrance fee for Bajiu isn't cheap.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.060
I'll ask around for you.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.900
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.020
- No problem.
- I'll get back to work.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:08.860
Sure, go ahead.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.740
Hello, how may I help you?

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.580
Well... I heard from your dad,

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.260
Mr. Shen,

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.060
that you're back at work.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.620
Don't push yourself too hard.
Don't get tired.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.140
You...

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:39.940
Right.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.220
I made you some turnip cabbage.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.220
If your stomach feels off,
it helps your appetite.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:44.820
No, it's okay.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.020
- Also...
- It's okay, really.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.260
I also made some beef.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.700
I braised it myself. Very clean.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.100
You can eat it slowly.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.740
You're working now,

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.220
I won't bother you anymore.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:57.420
Oh,

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.860
the turnip cabbage
is a pickled vegetable.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.900
It's not too good for the body.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.900
Don't eat too much.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:30.860
Mingzhu,

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.700
even though you're back at work,

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.460
don't tire yourself out.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.860
Come home for dinner tonight.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.900
We'll wait for you.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.420
Alright, Mom.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.540
(Lobby Manager)

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.780
Mingzhu,

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.980
the nursery room is done
after hanging the curtain.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.220
Invite your family over

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.060
to take a look this weekend.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.780
Let the grandparents
give us some advice.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.660
Sure. I'll talk to them when I get home.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.420
Good.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.900
That's settled then.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.500
This beef is really good.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.660
Mom, try it.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.420
Where did this beef come from?

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.780
A relative of mine sent it.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.420
Mingzhu,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.300
I don't think

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.140
this relative of yours
understands things.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.540
Last time they sent turnip cabbage,

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.580
and now spiced beef.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.940
Doesn't she know you're pregnant

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.620
and you can't just eat anything?

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.060
Is it clean? What if you get sick?

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.340
Miss.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.740
Come.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.860
Take this away.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.020
Take it away.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.700
They meant well.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:52.980
Eat.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.460
Mingzhu,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.100
Mom saw you liked that brand,
so she asked me to get you another pair.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.300
I chose red.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.060
See if you like it.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.660
If you don't, you can exchange it.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.700
Those shoes are too expensive.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.420
One pair is enough.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.900
Families like ours

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.940
can't wear just one pair of shoes.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.100
People may not say it,

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.260
but they'll look down on you.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.140
Let them. I don't care.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.420
You don't care,

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.700
but I care.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.620
I don't want to lose face.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.220
You know?

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.660
Ever since Meiqi was a kid,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.660
she's never worn the same clothes twice.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.100
Girls

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.380
need to look like

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.580
they come from a good family,

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.380
so others won't treat them lightly.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.540
She's singing.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.900
Who are you talking about?

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.220
I mean, you were right.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.900
Of course I'm right.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.740
Yeah.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.940
Mingzhu,

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.340
I told you I'll treat you
like my own daughter.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.940
Whatever Meiqi has, you'll have too.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.540
Thank you, Mom.

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.420
I'll wear them.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.220
That's right.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.540
Here. Eat up.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.580
Have more shrimp.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.900
Mingzhu.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.020
Your favorite milk tea with pearl.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.820
Come. Sit.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340
My mother-in-law.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.900
Look.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.700
She bought me another pair.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.580
The same style as mine,

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.140
just different colors.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.140
Our feet are the same size.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.740
Try them on.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.220
You're giving them to me?

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.140
I want to ask if you want to buy them.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.820
Why don't you return them?

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.460
I tried.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:46.780
But they told me

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.460
the refund has to go back
to my mother-in-law's credit card.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.900
I'm afraid she'll say I'm petty.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.260
And that you don't deserve
to marry into their family.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.980
Aren't those shoes
over six thousand a pair?

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.420
I already have one.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.980
I can't even bear to wear them.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.540
A bit more easygoing about it.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.020
If your mother-in-law gives it to you,
you gladly accept it.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.940
I was doing the math at home
the other day.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.420
I had no idea

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.020
until I calculated it.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.860
Kids are basically money pits.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.300
Everything costs money.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.180
I took a taxi today.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.620
The driver's baby was born premature.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.460
So it went straight into an incubator.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.700
That costs money too.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.180
From now on,

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.300
I'm going to

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.100
save every bit I can,

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.700
just in case.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.420
So you're planning

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.100
to sell these shoes to me?

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.420
Your mother-in-law gave them to you,

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.660
and you're selling them to me?

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.480
Does that make sense?

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.540
It's better to give my friend
a good deal than to a stranger.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.940
Fair enough.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.660
Name your price.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.940
This shoe never goes on sale in the store.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.780
So,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.660
since you're my friend,

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.420
I'll give you 30 per cent off.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.020
Are we besties? 50 per cent off.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.260
Are we besties? 40 per cent off.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.100
If you're not buying,
I'll put them up online.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:57.820
Hey.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.020
Your mother-in-law gave you these.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.060
If you never wear them,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.380
she'll be suspicious.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.300
Sell them to me.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.820
You can wear them home

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.660
and make her happy.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:08.860
If she's happy, everyone is happy.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.180
The whole family is happy.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.420
That makes sense.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.020
Then I'll sell them to Xiaoni's mom.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.180
She'll lend them back to me.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.700
Besides, she'll pay more.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.660
Alright. Stop.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.460
I'll add a hundred.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.700
No. Too low.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.820
Another hundred.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.780
Deal. Transfer the money.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.740
Fine.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:32.940
Excuse me.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.660
I'd like to see the one
I looked at earlier.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.620
Yes. This one.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.620
So you're buying gold bars?

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.820
Is someone turning eighty?

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.900
You don't get it.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.060
Gold holds value.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.220
From now on,

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.260
I'm saving real assets for the baby.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.040
What do you think of this one?

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.780
"Longevity."

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.660
Becoming a mother
really changes a person.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.900
It really does.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.820
Alright, I'll take this one.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:40:59.780
Sure. One moment.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.620
Okay.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.660
Thank you for the big gold bar,
Godmother.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.220
I've figured it out.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.940
Whenever I have money,

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.420
I'll buy gold for the baby.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.260
I'll keep saving

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.660
until they get married.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.220
By then, it'll be a whole box.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.980
I'll give it to them all at once.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.460
Isn't that generous?

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.780
What if the kid is a big spender?

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.860
They'll blow through it
before they get married.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.460
Why do I have a friend like you?

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.940
You're such a jinx.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.780
I'm telling you,

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.860
I'm not selling the good stuff
to you next time.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.700
Oh, I'm so scared.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.460
Please keep selling to me.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.100
Where else would I get deals like this?

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.740
I'm really scared.
You have to sell it to me.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.140
Mom,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.100
I've received several job offers

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.740
from Beijing and Shanghai.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.340
You're still leaving?

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.260
My major is marketing.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.420
The right jobs

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.660
are in big cities.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.220
Besides,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.140
the nursery room is almost ready.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.220
Once Mingzhu and the baby move in,

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.620
the house will feel lively.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.780
I won't worry.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.100
Alright then.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.140
Go to Shanghai.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.100
It's only one hour by high-speed rail.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.940
Close enough.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.580
Okay.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.020
Shanghai it is.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.620
Baby,

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.100
this is a gift from your godmother
and grandma.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.660
When you grow up,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.580
remember to thank them.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.100
(Longevity)

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:33.740
For now,

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.100
stay right here in my belly.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.980
Don't come early,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.660
and don't be late.
